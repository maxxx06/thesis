abstract = {Metagenomics and marker gene approaches, coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology. Metagenomics is a culture-independent method that allows the identification and characterization of organisms from all kinds of samples. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing analyses the total DNA of a chosen sample to determine the presence of micro-organisms from all domains of life and their genomic content. Importantly, the whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach reveals the genomic diversity present, but can also give insights into the functional potential of the micro-organisms identified. The marker gene approach is based on the sequencing of a specific gene region. It allows one to describe the microbial composition based on the taxonomic groups present in the sample. It is frequently used to analyse the biodiversity of microbial ecosystems. Despite its importance, the analysis of metagenomic sequencing and marker gene data is quite a challenge. Here we review the primary workflows and software used for both approaches and discuss the current challenges in the field.},

abstract = {Motivation: The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is widely used to survey microbial communities. Sequences are often clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) as proxies for species. The canonical clustering threshold is 97\% identity, which was proposed in 1994 when few 16S rRNA sequences were available, motivating a reassessment on current data. Results: Using a large set of high-quality 16S rRNA sequences from finished genomes, I assessed the correspondence of OTUs to species for five representative clustering algorithms using four accuracy metrics. All algorithms had comparable accuracy when tuned to a given metric. Optimal identity thresholds were ∼99\% for full-length sequences and ∼100\% for the V4 hypervariable region.},

abstract = {True fungi (Fungi) and fungus-like organisms (e.g. Mycetozoa, Oomycota) constitute the second largest group of organisms based on global richness estimates, with around 3 million predicted species. Compared to plants and animals, fungi have simple body plans with often morphologically and ecologically obscure structures. This poses challenges for accurate and precise identifications. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the identification of fungi, encouraging the approach of integrative (polyphasic) taxonomy for species delimitation, i.e. the combination of genealogy (phylogeny), phenotype (including autecology), and reproductive biology (when feasible). This allows objective evaluation of diagnostic characters, either phenotypic or molecular or both. Verification of identifications is crucial but often neglected. Because of clade-specific evolutionary histories, there is currently no single tool for the identification of fungi, although DNA barcoding using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) remains a first diagnosis, particularly in metabarcoding studies. Secondary DNA barcodes are increasingly implemented for groups where ITS does not provide sufficient precision. Issues of pairwise sequence similarity-based identifications and OTU clustering are discussed, and multiple sequence alignment-based phylogenetic approaches with subsequent verification are recommended as more accurate alternatives. In metabarcoding approaches, the trade-off between speed and accuracy and precision of molecular identifications must be carefully considered. Intragenomic variation of the ITS and other barcoding markers should be properly documented, as phylotype diversity is not necessarily a proxy of species richness. Important strategies to improve molecular identification of fungi are: (1) broadly document intraspecific and intragenomic variation of barcoding markers; (2) substantially expand sequence repositories, focusing on undersampled clades and missing taxa; (3) improve curation of sequence labels in primary repositories and substantially increase the number of sequences based on verified material; (4) link sequence data to digital information of voucher specimens including imagery. In parallel, technological improvements to genome sequencing offer promising alternatives to DNA barcoding in the future. Despite the prevalence of DNA-based fungal taxonomy, phenotype-based approaches remain an important strategy to catalog the global diversity of fungi and establish initial species hypotheses.},

abstract = {Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism's transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell. The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences. Measuring the expression of an organism's genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism's biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.},

abstract = {Background: Several genome-scale metabolic reconstruction software platforms have been developed and are being continuously updated. These tools have been widely applied to reconstruct metabolic models for hundreds of microorganisms ranging from important human pathogens to species of industrial relevance. However, these platforms, as yet, have not been systematically evaluated with respect to software quality, best potential uses and intrinsic capacity to generate high-quality, genome-scale metabolic models. It is therefore unclear for potential users which tool best fits the purpose of their research. Results: In this work, we perform a systematic assessment of current genome-scale reconstruction software platforms. To meet our goal, we first define a list of features for assessing software quality related to genome-scale reconstruction. Subsequently, we use the feature list to evaluate the performance of each tool. To assess the similarity of the draft reconstructions to high-quality models, we compare each tool's output networks with that of the high-quality, manually curated, models of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bordetella pertussis, representatives of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. We additionally compare draft reconstructions with a model of Pseudomonas putida to further confirm our findings. We show that none of the tools outperforms the others in all the defined features. Conclusions: Model builders should carefully choose a tool (or combinations of tools) depending on the intended use of the metabolic model. They can use this benchmark study as a guide to select the best tool for their research. Finally, developers can also benefit from this evaluation by getting feedback to improve their software.},

In addition, the annotated genome can be browsed in an environment that supports comparative analysis with the annotated genomes maintained in the SEED environment. The service normally makes the annotated genome available within 12-24 hours of submission, but ultimately the quality of such a service will be judged in terms of accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the produced annotations.

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are instrumental in uncovering operating principles of cellular metabolism, for model-guided re-engineering, and unraveling cross-feeding in microbial communities. Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual curation required to obtain good quality models. Here, we present an automated tool, CarveMe, for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, CarveMe uses a topdown approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We show that CarveMe models perform closely to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes (substrate utilization and gene essentiality). Additionally, we build a collection of 74 models for human gut bacteria and test their ability to reproduce growth on a set of experimentally defined media. Finally, we create a database of 5587 bacterial models and demonstrate its potential for fast generation of microbial community models. Overall, CarveMe provides an open-source and user-friendly tool towards broadening the use of metabolic modeling in studying microbial species and communities.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel computational approach, CoReCo, for comparative metabolic reconstruction and provide genome-scale metabolic network models for 49 important fungal species. Leveraging on the exponential growth in sequenced genome availability, our method reconstructs genome-scale gapless metabolic networks simultaneously for a large number of species by integrating sequence data in a probabilistic framework. High reconstruction accuracy is demonstrated by comparisons to the well-curated Saccharomyces cerevisiae consensus model and large-scale knock-out experiments. Our comparative approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the quality of available sequence data is lacking, and when reconstructing evolutionary distant species. Moreover, the reconstructed networks are fully carbon mapped, allowing their use in 13C flux analysis. We demonstrate the functionality and usability of the reconstructed fungal models with computational steady-state biomass production experiment, as these fungi include some of the most important production organisms in industrial biotechnology. In contrast to many existing reconstruction techniques, only minimal manual effort is required before the reconstructed models are usable in flux balance experiments.

It performs the major steps of the reconstruction process, including the functional genomic annotation of the whole genome and subsequent construction of the portfolio of reactions. Moreover, merlin includes tools for the identification and annotation of genes encoding transport proteins, generating the transport reactions for those carriers. It also performs the compartmentalisation of the model, predicting the organelle localisation of the proteins encoded in the genome and thus the localisation of the metabolites involved in the reactions promoted by such enzymes. The gene-proteins-reactions (GPR) associations are automatically generated and included in the model. Finally, merlin expedites the transition from genomic data to draft metabolic models reconstructions exported in the SBML standard format, allowing the user to have a preliminary view of the biochemical network, which can be manually curated within the environment provided by merlin.},

abstract = {RAVEN is a commonly used MATLAB toolbox for genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) reconstruction, curation and constraint-based modelling and simulation. Here we present RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) de novo reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with the COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 are here illustrated through de novo reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Comparison of the automated de novo reconstructions with the iMK1208 model, a previously published high-quality S. coelicolor GEM, exemplifies that RAVEN 2.0 can capture most of the manually curated model. The generated de novo reconstruction is subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of S. coelicolor, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allows the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production. As such, we demonstrate that RAVEN 2.0 can be used not only for de novo GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases. Both RAVEN 2.0 and Sco4 are distributed through GitHub to facilitate usage and further development by the community (https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN and https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Streptomyces_coelicolor-GEM).},

abstract = {Background: Constraint-based modeling is a widely used and powerful methodology to assess the metabolic phenotypes and capabilities of an organism. The starting point and cornerstone of all such modeling is a genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction. The creation, further development, and application of such networks is a growing field of research thanks to a plethora of readily accessible computational tools. While the majority of studies are focused on single-species analyses, typically of a microbe, the computational study of communities of organisms is gaining attention. Similarly, reconstructions that are unified for a multi-cellular organism have gained in popularity. Consequently, the rapid generation of genome-scale metabolic reconstructed networks is crucial. While multiple web-based or stand-alone tools are available for automated network reconstruction, there is, however, currently no publicly available tool that allows the swift assembly of draft reconstructions of community metabolic networks and consolidated metabolic networks for a specified list of organisms. Results: Here, we present AutoKEGGRec, an automated tool that creates first draft metabolic network reconstructions of single organisms, community reconstructions based on a list of organisms, and finally a consolidated reconstruction for a list of organisms or strains. AutoKEGGRec is developed in Matlab and works seamlessly with the COBRA Toolbox v3, and it is based on only using the KEGG database as external input. The generated first draft reconstructions are stored in SBML files and consist of all reactions for a KEGG organism ID and corresponding linked genes. This provides a comprehensive starting point for further refinement and curation using the host of COBRA toolbox functions or other preferred tools. Through the data structures created, the tool also facilitates a comparative analysis of metabolic content in any given number of organisms present in the KEGG database. Conclusion: AutoKEGGRec provides a first step in a metabolic network reconstruction process, filling a gap for tools creating community and consolidated metabolic networks. Based only on KEGG data as external input, the generated reconstructions consist of data with a directly traceable foundation and pedigree. With AutoKEGGRec, this kind of modeling is made accessible to a wider part of the genome-scale metabolic analysis community.},

abstract = {The accurate representation of all aspects of a metabolic network in a structured format, such that it can be used for a wide variety of computational analyses, is a challenge faced by a growing number of researchers. Analysis of five major metabolic pathway databases reveals that each database has made widely different choices to address this challenge, including how to deal with knowledge that is uncertain or missing. In concise overviews, we show how concepts such as compartments, enzymatic complexes and the direction of reactions are represented in each database. Importantly, also concepts which a database does not represent are described. Which aspects of the metabolic network need to be available in a structured format and to what detail differs per application. For example, for in silico phenotype prediction, a detailed representation of gene-protein-reaction relations and the compartmentalization of the network is essential. Our analysis also shows that current databases are still limited in capturing all details of the biology of the metabolic network, further illustrated with a detailed analysis of three metabolic processes. Finally, we conclude that the conceptual differences between the databases, which make knowledge exchange and integration a challenge, have not been resolved, so far, by the exchange formats in which knowledge representation is standardized. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein expression in the wild-type and evolved strains. Here, we report that >98\% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover, when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal growth phenotype in the evolved strains, such as the downregulation of known regulons and stringent response suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from wild-type and adaptively evolved strains supports observed growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM-computed optimal growth states. {\textcopyright} 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Genome-scale constraint-based models of several organisms have now been constructed and are being used for model driven research. A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant variation in growth rate if the flux variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological significance and general source of such flux variability is further investigated through the identification of redundancies in the network (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively, these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic flux distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide an efficient and robust method to calculate the range of flux distributions that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that the constraint-based modeling method Resource Balance Analysis (RBA), calibrated using genome-wide absolute protein quantification data, accurately predicts resource allocation in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis for a wide range of growth conditions. The regulation of most cellular processes is consistent with the objective of growth rate maximization except for a few suboptimal processes which likely integrate more complex objectives such as coping with stressful conditions and survival. As a proof of principle by using simulations, we illustrated how calibrated RBA could aid rational design of strains for maximizing protein production, offering new opportunities to investigate design principles in prokaryotes and to exploit them for biotechnological applications.},

Typically, FBA is used to study the metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system. However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have extended FBA to account for dynamics and present two different formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic FBA was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental data. The dynamic FBA formalism was also used to study the sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were also identified. Therefore, dynamic FBA provides a framework for analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of metabolic networks.},

Here we report how predator-prey interactions alter the evolution of fitness, genomes and phenotypic diversity in coevolving bacterial communities composed of Myxococcus xanthus as predator and Escherichia coli as prey, relative to single-species controls. We show evidence of reciprocal adaptation and demonstrate accelerated genomic evolution specific to coevolving communities, including the rapid appearance of mutator genotypes. Strong parallel evolution unique to the predator-prey communities occurs in both parties, with predators driving adaptation at two prey traits associated with virulence in bacterial pathogens—mucoidy and the outer-membrane protease OmpT. Our results suggest that generalist predatory bacteria are important determinants of how complex microbial communities and their interaction networks evolve in natural habitats.},

We then construct co-occurrence networks and evaluate how well networks reveal the underlying interactions and how experimental and ecological parameters can affect network inference and interpretation. We find that co-occurrence networks can recapitulate interaction networks under certain conditions, but that they lose interpretability when the effects of habitat filtering become significant. We demonstrate that networks suffer from local hot spots of spurious correlation in the neighborhood of hub species that engage in many interactions.

Engineered microbial communities are also extremely relevant to tackling some of today's grand societal challenges. Advanced meta-omics experimental techniques provide crucial insights into microbial communities, but have been so far mostly used for descriptive, exploratory approaches to answer the initial ‘who is there?’ question. An ecosystem is a complex network of dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among organisms as well as between organisms and the environment. Mathematical models with their abstraction capability are essential to capture the underlying phenomena and connect the different scales at which these systems act. Differential equation models and constraint-based stoichiometric models are deterministic approaches that can successfully provide a macroscopic description of the outcome from microscopic behaviors. In this mini-review, we present classical and recent applications of these modeling methods and illustrate the potential of their integration. Indeed, approaches that can capture multiple scales are needed in order to understand emergent patterns in ecosystems and their dynamics regulated by different spatio-temporal phenomena. We finally discuss promising examples of methods proposing the integration of differential equations with constraint-based stoichiometric models and argue that more work is needed in this direction.}",

Understanding how the microbiota confers resistance against enteric pathogens and how antibiotics disrupt that resistance is key to the prevention and cure of intestinal infections. We present a novel method to infer microbial community ecology directly from time-resolved metagenomics. This method extends generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics to account for external perturbations. Data from recent experiments on antibiotic-mediated Clostridium difficile infection is analyzed to quantify microbial interactions, commensal-pathogen interactions, and the effect of the antibiotic on the community. Stability analysis reveals that the microbiota is intrinsically stable, explaining how antibiotic perturbations and C. difficile inoculation can produce catastrophic shifts that persist even after removal of the perturbations. Importantly, the analysis suggests a subnetwork of bacterial groups implicated in protection against C. difficile. Due to its generality, our method can be applied to any high-resolution ecological time-series data to infer community structure and response to external stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2013 Stein et al.},

This definition relates to existing concepts of null-space vectors and includes a condition of simplicity. It is shown that for systems in which all fluxes have fixed signs, all elementary modes are given by the generating vectors of a convex cone and can, thus, be computed by an existing algorithm. The present analysis allows for the more general case that some reactions can proceed in either direction. Basic ideas on how to compute the complete set of elementary modes in this situation are outlined and verified by way of several examples, with one of them representing glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. These examples show that the elementary modes can be interpreted in terms of the particular biochemical functions of the network. The relationships to (futile) substrate cycles are elucidated. }

However, the number of EFMs typically grows exponentially with the size of the metabolic network, leading to excessive computational demands, and unfortunately, a large fraction of these EFMs are not biologically feasible due to system constraints. This combinatorial explosion often prevents the complete analysis of genome-scale metabolic models. Traditionally, EFMs are computed by the double description method, an efficient algorithm based on matrix calculation; however, only a few constraints can be integrated into this computation. They must be monotonic with regard to the set inclusion of the supports; otherwise, they must be treated in post-processing and thus do not save computational time. We present aspefm, a hybrid computational tool based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Linear Programming (LP) that permits the computation of EFMs while implementing many different types of constraints. We apply our methodology to the Escherichia coli core model, which contains 226 × 106 EFMs. In considering transcriptional and environmental regulation, thermodynamic constraints, and resource usage considerations, the solution space is reduced to 1118 EFMs that can be computed directly with aspefm. The solution set, for E. coli growth on O2 gradients spanning fully aerobic to anaerobic, can be further reduced to four optimal EFMs using post-processing and Pareto front analysis.},

abstract = {Metabolic network modeling of microbial communities provides an in-depth understanding of community-wide metabolic and regulatory processes. Compared to single organism analyses, community metabolic network modeling is more complex because it needs to account for interspecies interactions. To date, most approaches focus on reconstruction of high-quality individual networks so that, when combined, they can predict community behaviors as a result of interspecies interactions. However, this conventional method becomes ineffective for communities whose members are not well characterized and cannot be experimentally interrogated in isolation. Here, we tested a new approach that uses community-level data as a critical input for the network reconstruction process. This method focuses on directly predicting interspecies metabolic interactions in a community, when axenic information is insufficient. We validated our method through the case study of a bacterial photoautotroph–heterotroph consortium that was used to provide data needed for a community-level metabolic network reconstruction. Resulting simulations provided experimentally validated predictions of how a photoautotrophic cyanobacterium supports the growth of an obligate heterotrophic species by providing organic carbon and nitrogen sources.

abstract = {Compositional changes in the gut microbiota have been associated with a variety of medical conditions such as obesity, Crohn\textquoterights disease, and diabetes. However, connecting microbial community composition to ecosystem function remains a challenge. Here, we introduce MICOM, a customizable metabolic model of the human gut microbiome. By using a heuristic optimization approach based on L2 regularization, we were able to obtain a unique set of realistic growth rates that corresponded well with observed replication rates. We integrated adjustable dietary and taxon abundance constraints to generate personalized metabolic models for individual metagenomic samples. We applied MICOM to a balanced cohort of metagenomes from 186 people, including a metabolically healthy population and individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Model results showed that individual bacterial genera maintained conserved niche structures across humans, while the community-level production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was heterogeneous and highly individual specific. Model output revealed complex cross-feeding interactions that would be difficult to measure in vivo. Metabolic interaction networks differed somewhat consistently between healthy and diabetic subjects. In particular, MICOM predicted reduced butyrate and propionate production in a diabetic cohort, with restoration of SCFA production profiles found in healthy subjects following metformin treatment. Overall, we found that changes in diet or taxon abundances have highly personalized effects. We believe MICOM can serve as a useful tool for generating mechanistic hypotheses for how diet and microbiome composition influence community function. All methods are implemented in an open-source Python package, which is available at https://github.com/micom-dev/micom.IMPORTANCE The bacterial communities that live within the human gut have been linked to health and disease. However, we are still just beginning to understand how those bacteria interact and what potential interventions to our gut microbiome can make us healthier. Here, we present a mathematical modeling framework (named MICOM) that can recapitulate the growth rates of diverse bacterial species in the gut and can simulate metabolic interactions within microbial communities. We show that MICOM can unravel the ecological rules that shape the microbial landscape in our gut and that a given dietary or probiotic intervention can have widely different effects in different people.},

@article{Chan2017,
abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint, the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other microbes in the community. This is particularly important for predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes significant restrictions on the allowable community membership, composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement. SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis. SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four E. coli double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a microbial community in a given environment.},

abstract = {Background: Microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and play a major role in ecology, medicine, and various industrial processes. In this study, we used stoichiometric metabolic modeling to investigate a community of three species, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Methanococcus maripaludis, and Methanosarcina barkeri, which are involved in acetogenesis and methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion for biogas production. Results: We first constructed and validated stoichiometric models of the core metabolism of the three species which were then assembled to community models. The community was simulated by applying the previously described concept of balanced growth demanding that all organisms of the community grow with equal specific growth rate. For predicting community compositions, we propose a novel hierarchical optimization approach: first, similar to other studies, a maximization of the specific community growth rate is performed which, however, often leads to a wide range of optimal community compositions. In a secondary optimization, we therefore also demand that all organisms must grow with maximum biomass yield (optimal substrate usage) reducing the range of predicted optimal community compositions. Simulating two-species as well as three-species communities of the three representative organisms, we gained several important insights. First, using our new optimization approach we obtained predictions on optimal community compositions for different substrates which agree well with measured data. Second, we found that the ATP maintenance coefficient influences significantly the predicted community composition, especially for small growth rates. Third, we observed that maximum methane production rates are reached under high-specific community growth rates and if at least one of the organisms converts its substrate(s) with suboptimal biomass yield. On the other hand, the maximum methane yield is obtained at low community growth rates and, again, when one of the organisms converts its substrates suboptimally and thus wastes energy. Finally, simulations in the three-species community clarify exchangeability and essentiality of the methanogens in case of alternative substrate usage and competition scenarios. Conclusions: In summary, our study presents new methods for stoichiometric modeling of microbial communities in general and provides valuable insights in interdependencies of bacterial species involved in the biogas process.},

abstract = {A central focus in studies of microbial communities is the elucidation of the relationships between genotype, phenotype, and dynamic community structure. Here, we present a new computational method called community flux balance analysis (cFBA) to study the metabolic behavior of microbial communities. cFBA integrates the comprehensive metabolic capacities of individual microorganisms in terms of (genome-scale) stoichiometric models of metabolism, and the metabolic interactions between species in the community and abiotic processes. In addition, cFBA considers constraints deriving from reaction stoichiometry, reaction thermodynamics, and the ecosystem. cFBA predicts for communities at balanced growth the maximal community growth rate, the required rates of metabolic reactions within and between microbes and the relative species abundances. In order to predict species abundances and metabolic activities at the optimal community growth rate, a nonlinear optimization problem needs to be solved. We outline the methodology of cFBA and illustrate the approach with two examples of microbial communities. These examples illustrate two useful applications of cFBA. Firstly, cFBA can be used to study how specific biochemical limitations in reaction capacities cause different types of metabolic limitations that microbial consortia can encounter. In silico variations of those maximal capacities allow for a global view of the consortium responses to various metabolic and environmental constraints. Secondly, cFBA is very useful for comparing the performance of different metabolic cross-feeding strategies to either find one that agrees with experimental data or one that is most efficient for the community of microorganisms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Khandelwal et al.},

abstract = {Microorganisms rarely live isolated in their natural environments but rather function in consolidated and socializing communities. Despite the growing availability of high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic data, we still know very little about the metabolic contributions of individual microbial players within an ecological niche and the extent and directionality of interactions among them. This calls for development of efficient modeling frameworks to shed light on less understood aspects of metabolism in microbial communities. Here, we introduce OptCom, a comprehensive flux balance analysis framework for microbial communities, which relies on a multi-level and multi-objective optimization formulation to properly describe trade-offs between individual vs. community level fitness criteria. In contrast to earlier approaches that rely on a single objective function, here, we consider species-level fitness criteria for the inner problems while relying on community-level objective maximization for the outer problem. OptCom is general enough to capture any type of interactions (positive, negative or combinations thereof) and is capable of accommodating any number of microbial species (or guilds) involved. We applied OptCom to quantify the syntrophic association in a well-characterized two-species microbial system, assess the level of sub-optimal growth in phototrophic microbial mats, and elucidate the extent and direction of inter-species metabolite and electron transfer in a model microbial community. We also used OptCom to examine addition of a new member to an existing community. Our study demonstrates the importance of trade-offs between species- and community-level fitness driving forces and lays the foundation for metabolic-driven analysis of various types of interactions in multi-species microbial systems using genome-scale metabolic models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Zomorrodi, Maranas.},

abstract = {Motivation: Microbial metabolic interactions impact ecosystems, human health and biotechnology profoundly. However, their determination remains elusive, invoking an urgent need for predictive models seamlessly integrating metabolism with evolutionary principles that shape community interactions. Results: Inspired by the evolutionary game theory, we formulated a bi-level optimization framework termed NECom for which any feasible solutions are Nash equilibria of microbial community metabolic models with/without an outer-level (community) objective function. Distinct from discrete matrix games, NECom models the continuous interdependent strategy space of metabolic fluxes. We showed that NECom successfully predicted several classical games in the context of metabolic interactions that were falsely or incompletely predicted by existing methods, including prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and cooperation. The improved capability originates from the novel formulation to prevent 'forced altruism' hidden in previous static algorithms while allowing for sensing all potential metabolite exchanges to determine evolutionarily favorable interactions between members, a feature missing in dynamic methods. The results provided insights into why mutualism is favorable despite seemingly costly cross-feeding metabolites and demonstrated similarities and differences between games in the continuous metabolic flux space and matrix games. NECom was then applied to a reported algae-yeast co-culture system that shares typical cross-feeding features of lichen, a model system of mutualism. 488 growth conditions corresponding to 3221 experimental data points were simulated. Without training any parameters using the data, NECom is more predictive of species' growth rates given uptake rates compared with flux balance analysis with an overall 63.5\% and 81.7\% reduction in root-mean-square error for the two species respectively.},

abstract = {The advent of rapid complete genome sequencing, and the potential to capture this information in genome-scale metabolic models, provide the possibility of comprehensively modeling microbial community interactions. For example, Rhodoferax and Geobacter species are acetate-oxidizing Fe(III)-reducers that compete in anoxic subsurface environments and this competition may have an influence on the in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater. Therefore, genome-scale models of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Rhodoferax ferrireducens were used to evaluate how Geobacter and Rhodoferax species might compete under diverse conditions found in a uranium-contaminated aquifer in Rifle, CO. The model predicted that at the low rates of acetate flux expected under natural conditions at the site, Rhodoferax will outcompete Geobacter as long as sufficient ammonium is available. The model also predicted that when high concentrations of acetate are added during in situ bioremediation, Geobacter species would predominate, consistent with field-scale observations. This can be attributed to the higher expected growth yields of Rhodoferax and the ability of Geobacter to fix nitrogen. The modeling predicted relative proportions of Geobacter and Rhodoferax in geochemically distinct zones of the Rifle site that were comparable to those that were previously documented with molecular techniques. The model also predicted that under nitrogen fixation, higher carbon and electron fluxes would be diverted toward respiration rather than biomass formation in Geobacter, providing a potential explanation for enhanced in situ U(VI) reduction in low-ammonium zones. These results show that genome-scale modeling can be a useful tool for predicting microbial interactions in subsurface environments and shows promise for designing bioremediation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Microbial communities are pervasive in the natural environment, associated with many hosts, and of increasing importance in biotechnological applications. The complexity of these microbial systems makes the underlying mechanisms driving their dynamics difficult to identify. While experimental meta-OMICS techniques are routinely applied to record the inventory and activity of microbiomes over time, it remains difficult to obtain quantitative predictions based on such data. Mechanistic, quantitative mathematical modeling approaches hold the promise to both provide predictive power and shed light on cause-effect relationships driving these dynamic systems. We introduce $\mu$bialSim (pronounced “microbial sim”), a dynamic Flux-Balance-Analysis-based (dFBA) numerical simulator which is able to predict the time course in terms of composition and activity of microbiomes containing 100s of species in batch or chemostat mode. Activity of individual species is simulated by using separate FBA models which have access to a common pool of compounds, allowing for metabolite exchange. A novel augmented forward Euler method ensures numerical accuracy by temporarily reducing the time step size when compound concentrations decrease rapidly due to high compound affinities and/or the presence of many consuming species. We present three exemplary applications of $\mu$bialSim: a batch culture of a hydrogenotrophic archaeon, a syntrophic methanogenic biculture, and a 773-species human gut microbiome which exhibits a complex and dynamic pattern of metabolite exchange. Focusing on metabolite exchange as the main interaction type, $\mu$bialSim allows for the mechanistic simulation of microbiomes at their natural complexity. Simulated trajectories can be used to contextualize experimental meta-OMICS data and to derive hypotheses on cause-effect relationships driving community dynamics based on scenario simulations. $\mu$bialSim is implemented in Matlab and relies on the COBRA Toolbox or CellNetAnalyzer for FBA calculations.

Model p-ath773 has been designed to show broad agreement with published plant-scale properties such as mass, maintenance, and senescence, yet leaving reaction-level behavior unconstrainted. Hence, it serves as a framework to study the reaction-level behavior necessary for observed plant-scale behavior. Two such case studies of reaction-level behavior include the lifecycle progression of sulfur metabolism and the diurnal flow of water throughout the plant. Specifically, p-ath773 shows how transpiration drives water flow through the plant and how water produced by leaf tissue metabolism may contribute significantly to transpired water. Investigation of sulfur metabolism elucidates frequent cross-compartment exchange of a standing pool of amino acids which is used to regulate the proton flow. Overall, p-ath773 and ORKA serve as scaffolds for dFBA-based lifecycle modeling of plants and other systems to further broaden the scope of in silico metabolic investigation.},

abstract = {Microbes have an astonishing capacity to transform their environments. Yet, the metabolic capacity of a single species is limited and the vast majority of microorganisms form complex communities and join forces to exhibit capabilities far exceeding those achieved by any single species. Such enhanced metabolic capacities represent a promising route to many medical, environmental, and industrial applications and call for the development of a predictive, systems-level understanding of synergistic microbial capacity. Here we present a comprehensive computational framework, integrating high-quality metabolic models of multiple species, temporal dynamics, and flux variability analysis, to study the metabolic capacity and dynamics of simple two-species microbial ecosystems. We specifically focus on detecting emergent biosynthetic capacity - instances in which a community growing on some medium produces and secretes metabolites that are not secreted by any member species when growing in isolation on that same medium. Using this framework to model a large collection of two-species communities on multiple media, we demonstrate that emergent biosynthetic capacity is highly prevalent. We identify commonly observed emergent metabolites and metabolic reprogramming patterns, characterizing typical mechanisms of emergent capacity. We further find that emergent secretion tends to occur in two waves, the first as soon as the two organisms are introduced, and the second when the medium is depleted and nutrients become limited. Finally, aiming to identify global community determinants of emergent capacity, we find a marked association between the level of emergent biosynthetic capacity and the functional/phylogenetic distance between community members. Specifically, we demonstrate a "Goldilocks" principle, where high levels of emergent capacity are observed when the species comprising the community are functionally neither too close, nor too distant. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential to design and engineer synthetic communities capable of novel metabolic activities and point to promising future directions in environmental and clinical bioengineering. {\textcopyright} 2014 Chiu et al.},

Experimental validation of flux predictions for this pair confirms metabolic interactions and potential production capabilities. Synthetic communities bypass member-specific metabolic bottlenecks (e.g. histidine- and transport-related reactions) and compensate for lethal genetic traits, achieving up to 27\% recovery from lethal knockouts. The study provides a robust modelling framework for the rational design of synthetic communities with optimized growth sustainability using phototrophic partners.},

abstract = {Understanding the fundamental characteristics of microbial communities could have far reaching implications for human health and applied biotechnology. Despite this, much is still unknown regarding the genetic basis and evolutionary strategies underlying the formation of viable synthetic communities. By pairing auxotrophic mutants in co-culture, it has been demonstrated that viable nascent E. coli communities can be established where the mutant strains are metabolically coupled. A novel algorithm, OptAux, was constructed to design 61 unique multi-knockout E. coli auxotrophic strains that require significant metabolite uptake to grow. These predicted knockouts included a diverse set of novel non-specific auxotrophs that result from inhibition of major biosynthetic subsystems. Three OptAux predicted nonspecific auxotrophic strains—with diverse metabolic deficiencies—were co-cultured with an L-histidine auxotroph and optimized via adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). Time-course sequencing revealed the genetic changes employed by each strain to achieve higher community growth rates and provided insight into mechanisms for adapting to the syntrophic niche. A community model of metabolism and gene expression was utilized to predict the relative community composition and fundamental characteristics of the evolved communities. This work presents new insight into the genetic strategies underlying viable nascent community formation and a cutting-edge computational method to elucidate metabolic changes that empower the creation of cooperative communities.},

	abstract = {Interactions between microbial species are sometimes mediated by the exchange of small molecules, secreted by one species and metabolized by another. Both one-way (commensal) and two-way (mutualistic) interactions may contribute to complex networks of interdependencies. Understanding these interactions constitutes an open challenge in microbial ecology, with applications ranging from the human microbiome to environmental sustainability. In parallel to natural communities, it is possible to explore interactions in artificial microbial ecosystems, e.g. pairs of genetically engineered mutualistic strains. Here we computationally generate artificial microbial ecosystems without re-engineering the microbes themselves, but rather by predicting their growth on appropriately designed media. We use genome-scale stoichiometric models of metabolism to identify media that can sustain growth for a pair of species, but fail to do so for one or both individual species, thereby inducing putative symbiotic interactions. We first tested our approach on two previously studied mutualistic pairs, and on a pair of highly curated model organisms, showing that our algorithms successfully recapitulate known interactions, robustly predict new ones, and provide novel insight on exchanged molecules. We then applied our method to all possible pairs of seven microbial species, and found that it is always possible to identify putative media that induce commensalism or mutualism. Our analysis also suggests that symbiotic interactions may arise more readily through environmental fluctuations than genetic modifications. We envision that our approach will help generate microbe-microbe interaction maps useful for understanding microbial consortia dynamics and evolution, and for exploring the full potential of natural metabolic pathways for metabolic engineering applications.},

abstract = {Despite a growing understanding of how environmental composition affects microbial communities, it remains difficult to apply this knowledge to the rational design of synthetic multispecies consortia. This is because natural microbial communities can harbour thousands of different organisms and environmental substrates, making up a vast combinatorial space that precludes exhaustive experimental testing and computational prediction. Here, we present a method based on the combination of machine learning and metabolic modelling that selects optimal environmental compositions to produce target community phenotypes. In this framework, dynamic flux balance analysis is used to model the growth of a community in candidate environments. A genetic algorithm is then used to evaluate the behaviour of the community relative to a target phenotype, and subsequently adjust the environment to allow the organisms to approach this target. We apply this iterative process to thousands of in silico communities of varying sizes, showing how it can rapidly identify environments that yield desired taxonomic compositions and patterns of metabolic exchange. Moreover, this combination of approaches produces testable predictions for the assembly of experimental microbial communities with specific properties and can facilitate rational environmental design processes for complex microbiomes.},

abstract = {Motivation Synthetic microbial communities begin to be considered as promising multicellular biocatalysts having a large potential to replace engineered single strains in biotechnology applications, in pharmaceutical, chemical and living architecture sectors. In contrast to single strain engineering, the effective and high-throughput analysis and engineering of microbial consortia face the lack of knowledge, tools and well-defined workflows. This manuscript contributes to fill this important gap with a framework, called FLYCOP (FLexible sYnthetic Consortium OPtimization), which contributes to microbial consortia modeling and engineering, while improving the knowledge about how these communities work. FLYCOP selects the best consortium configuration to optimize a given goal, among multiple and diverse configurations, in a flexible way, taking temporal changes in metabolite concentrations into account. Results In contrast to previous systems optimizing microbial consortia, FLYCOP has novel characteristics to face up to new problems, to represent additional features and to analyze events influencing the consortia behavior. In this manuscript, FLYCOP optimizes a Synechococcus elongatus-Pseudomonas putida consortium to produce the maximum amount of bio-plastic (PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate), and highlights the influence of metabolites exchange dynamics in a four auxotrophic Escherichia coli consortium with parallel growth. FLYCOP can also provide an explanation about biological evolution driving evolutionary engineering endeavors by describing why and how heterogeneous populations emerge from monoclonal ones.

To investigate and eventually understand the emergent global behavior arising from such networks of interaction is not possible by intuitive reasoning alone. This contribution seeks to describe recent computational approaches that aim to asses the topological and functional properties of metabolic networks. In particular, based on a recently proposed method, it is shown that it is possible to acquire a quantitative picture of the possible dynamics of metabolic systems, without assuming detailed knowledge of the underlying enzyme-kinetic rate equations and parameters. Rather, the method builds upon a statistical exploration of the comprehensive parameter space to evaluate the dynamic capabilities of a metabolic system, thus providing a first step towards the transition from topology to function of metabolic pathways. Utilizing this approach, the role of feedback mechanisms in the maintenance of stability is discussed using minimal models of cellular pathways. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the connectivity of the metabolites follows a power law, another unusual but by no means rare statistical distribution.

abstract = {A new method for the mathematical analysis of large metabolic networks is presented. Based on the fact that the occurrence of a metabolic reaction generally requires the existence of other reactions providing its substrates, series of metabolic networks are constructed. In each step of the corresponding expansion process those reactions are incorporated whose substrates are made available by the networks of the previous generations. The method is applied to the set of all metabolic reactions included in the KEGG database. Starting with one or more seed compounds, the expansion results in a final network whose compounds define the scope of the seed. Scopes of all metabolic compounds are calculated and it is shown that large parts of cellular metabolism can be considered as the combined scope of simple building blocks. Analyses of various expansion processes reveal crucial metabolites whose incorporation allows for the increase in network complexity. Among these metabolites are common cofactors such as NAD+, ATP, and coenzyme A. We demonstrate that the outcome of network expansion is in general very robust against elimination of single or few reactions. There exist, however, crucial reactions whose elimination results in a dramatic reduction of scope sizes. It is hypothesized that the expansion process displays characteristics of the evolution of metabolism such as the temporal order of the emergence of metabolic pathways. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “{\`{a}} la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.},

Using these methods, such studies have revealed evolutionary and ecological processes that shape species interactions and community assembly, highlighting the potential of this reverse-ecology research paradigm. Results: NetCooperate is a web-based tool and a software package for determining host-microbe and microbe-microbe cooperative potential. It specifically calculates two previously developed and validated metrics for species interaction: the Biosynthetic Support Score which quantifies the ability of a host species to supply the nutritional requirements of a parasitic or a commensal species, and the Metabolic Complementarity Index which quantifies the complementarity of a pair of microbial organisms' niches. NetCooperate takes as input a pair of metabolic networks, and returns the pairwise metrics as well as a list of potential syntrophic metabolic compounds. Conclusions: The Biosynthetic Support Score and Metabolic Complementarity Index provide insight into host-microbe and microbe-microbe metabolic interactions. NetCooperate determines these interaction indices from metabolic network topology, and can be used for small- or large-scale analyses. NetCooperate is provided as both a web-based tool and an open-source Python module; both are freely available online at http://elbo.gs.washington.edu/software_netcooperate.html.},

abstract = {The human microbiome plays a key role in human health and is associated with numerous diseases. Metagenomic-based studies are now generating valuable information about the composition of the microbiome in health and in disease, demonstrating nonneutral assembly processes and complex co-occurrence patterns. However, the underlying ecological forces that structure the microbiome are still unclear. Specifically, compositional studies alone with no information about mechanisms of interaction, potential competition, or syntrophy, cannot clearly distinguish habitat-filtering and species assortment assembly processes. To address this challenge, we introduce a computational framework, integrating metagenomic-based compositional data with genome-scale metabolic modeling of species interaction. We use in silico metabolic network models to predict levels of competition and complementarity among 154 microbiome species and compare predicted interaction measures to species co-occurrence. Applying this approach to two large-scale datasets describing the composition of the gut microbiome, we find that species tend to co-occur across individuals more frequently with species with which they strongly compete, suggesting that microbiome assembly is dominated by habitat filtering. Moreover, species' partners and excluders exhibit distinct metabolic interaction levels. Importantly, we show that these trends cannot be explained by phylogeny alone and hold across multiple taxonomic levels. Interestingly, controlling for host health does not change the observed patterns, indicating that the axes along which species are filtered are not fully defined by macroecological host states. The approach presented here lays the foundation for a reverse-ecology framework for addressing key questions concerning the assembly of host-associated communities and for informing clinical efforts to manipulate the microbiome.},

abstract = {Revealing the ecological principles that shape communities is a major challenge of the post-genomic era. To date, a systematic approach for describing inter-species interactions has been lacking. Here we independently predict the competitive and cooperative potential between 6,903 bacterial pairs derived from a collection of 118 species' metabolic models. We chart an intricate association between competition and cooperation indicating that the cooperative potential is maximized at moderate levels of resource overlap. Utilizing ecological data from 2,801 samples, we explore the associations between bacterial interactions and coexistence patterns. The high level of competition observed between species with mutual-exclusive distribution patterns supports the role of competition in community assembly. Cooperative interactions are typically unidirectional with no obvious benefit to the giver. However, within their natural communities, bacteria typically form close cooperative loops resulting in indirect benefit to all species involved. These findings are important for the future design of consortia optimized towards bioremediation and bio-production applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background: The explosive growth of microbiome research has yielded great quantities of data. These data provide us with many answers, but raise just as many questions. 16S rDNA-the backbone of microbiome analyses-allows us to assess $\alpha$-diversity, $\beta$-diversity, and microbe-microbe associations, which characterize the overall properties of an ecosystem. However, we are still unable to use 16S rDNA data to directly assess the microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions that determine the broader ecology of that system. Thus, properties such as competition, cooperation, and nutrient conditions remain insufficiently analyzed. Here, we apply predictive community metabolic models of microbes identified with 16S rDNA data to probe the ecology of microbial communities. Results: We developed a methodology for the large-scale assessment of microbial metabolic interactions (MMinte) from 16S rDNA data. MMinte assesses the relative growth rates of interacting pairs of organisms within a community metabolic network and whether that interaction has a positive or negative effect. Moreover, MMinte's simulations take into account the nutritional environment, which plays a strong role in determining the metabolism of individual microbes. We present two case studies that demonstrate the utility of this software. In the first, we show how diet influences the nature of the microbe-microbe interactions. In the second, we use MMinte's modular feature set to better understand how the growth of Desulfovibrio piger is affected by, and affects the growth of, other members in a simplified gut community under metabolic conditions suggested to be determinant for their dynamics. Conclusion: By applying metabolic models to commonly available sequence data, MMinte grants the user insight into the metabolic relationships between microbes, highlighting important features that may relate to ecological stability, susceptibility, and cross-feeding. These relationships are at the foundation of a wide range of ecological questions that impact our ability to understand problems such as microbially-derived toxicity in colon cancer.},

Yet, the re-organization of microbial interactions between pairwise cultures and larger communities remains largely unexplored from a molecular perspective but is central to our understanding and further manipulation of microbial communities. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to investigate microbial interaction mechanisms from pairwise cultures up to 4-species communities from a simple microbiome (Hafnia alvei, Geotrichum candidum, Pencillium camemberti and Escherichia coli). Specifically, we characterized the interaction landscape for each species combination involving E. coli by identifying E. coli's interaction-associated mutants using an RB-TnSeq-based interaction assay. We observed a deep reorganization of the interaction-associated mutants, with very few 2-species interactions conserved all the way up to a 4-species community and the emergence of multiple HOIs. We further used a quantitative genetics strategy to decipher how 2-species interactions were quantitatively conserved in higher community compositions. Epistasis-based analysis revealed that, of the interactions that are conserved at all levels of complexity, 82\% follow an additive pattern. Altogether, we demonstrate the complex architecture of microbial interactions even within a simple microbiome, and provide a mechanistic and molecular explanation of HOIs.},

abstract = {Microbial communities populate most environments on earth and play a critical role in ecology and human health. Their composition is thought to be largely shaped by interspecies competition for the available resources, but cooperative interactions, such as metabolite exchanges, have also been implicated in community assembly. The prevalence of metabolic interactions in microbial communities, however, has remained largely unknown. Here, we systematically survey, by using a genome-scale metabolic modeling approach, the extent of resource competition and metabolic exchanges in over 800 communities. We find that, despite marked resource competition at the level of whole assemblies, microbial communities harbor metabolically interdependent groups that recur across diverse habitats. By enumerating flux-balanced metabolic exchanges in these co-occurring subcommunities we also predict the likely exchanged metabolites, such as amino acids and sugars, that can promote group survival under nutritionally challenging conditions. Our results highlight metabolic dependencies as a major driver of species co-occurrence and hint at cooperative groups as recurring modules of microbial community architecture.},

In fact, hybrid modelling can be more than that since any types of coupled formalisms qualify as being hybrid. This review first presents the evolution and current context of this modelling approach.

abstract = {Metabolic networks play a crucial role in biology since they capture all chemical reactions in an organism. While there are networks of high quality for many model organisms, networks for less studied organisms are often of poor quality and suffer from incompleteness. To this end, we introduced in previous work an answer set programming (ASP)-based approach to metabolic network completion. Although this qualitative approach allows for restoring moderately degraded networks, it fails to restore highly degraded ones. This is because it ignores quantitative constraints capturing reaction rates. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid approach to metabolic network completion that integrates our qualitative ASP approach with quantitative means for capturing reaction rates. We begin by formally reconciling existing stoichiometric and topological approaches to network completion in a unified formalism. With it, we develop a hybrid ASP encoding and rely upon the theory reasoning capacities of the ASP system clingo for solving the resulting logic program with linear constraints over reals. We empirically evaluate our approach by means of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli. Our analysis shows that our novel approach yields greatly superior results than obtainable from purely qualitative or quantitative approaches.},

abstract = {We introduce a new flexible paradigm of grounding and solving in Answer Set Programming (ASP), which we refer to as multi-shot ASP solving, and present its implementation in the ASP system clingo. Multi-shot ASP solving features grounding and solving processes that deal with continuously changing logic programs. In doing so, they remain operative and accommodate changes in a seamless way. For instance, such processes allow for advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or interaction with an environment, as in robotics or query answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. This evolutionary aspect adds another dimension to ASP since it brings about state changing operations. We address this issue by providing an operational semantics that characterizes grounding and solving processes in multi-shot ASP solving. This characterization provides a semantic account of grounder and solver states along with the operations manipulating them. The operative nature of multi-shot solving avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language with control capacities. On the declarative side, a new directive allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side. To this end, clingo offers a new application programming interface that is conveniently accessible via scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control, clingo also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.},

We describe telingo, an extension of the ASP system clingo with temporal operators over finite linear time and provide insights into its implementation. telingo takes temporal logic programs as input whose rules contain only future and present operators in their heads and past and present operators in their bodies. Moreover, telingo extends the grammar of clingo's input language with a variety of temporal operators that can even be used to represent nested temporal formulas. By using clingo's interface for manipulating the abstract syntax tree of non-ground programs, temporal logic programs are transformed into regular ones before grounding. The resulting regular logic program is then solved incremen-tally by using clingo's multi-shot interface. Notably, this involves the consecutive unfolding of future temporal operators that is accomplished via external atoms. Finally, we provide an empirical evaluation contrasting standard incremental ASP programs with their temporal counterparts in telingo's input language.},

abstract = {Currently, the main role of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) in wine is to conduct the malolactic fermentation (MLF). This process can increase wine aroma and mouthfeel, improve microbial stability and reduce the acidity of wine. A growing number of studies support the appreciation that LAB can also significantly, positively and negatively, contribute to the sensorial profile of wine through many different enzymatic pathways. This is achieved either through the synthesis of compounds such as diacetyl and esters or by liberating bound aroma compounds such as glycoside-bound primary aromas and volatile thiols which are odorless in their bound form. LAB can also liberate hydroxycinnamic acids from their tartaric esters and have the potential to break down anthocyanin glucosides, thus impacting wine color. LAB can also produce enzymes with the potential to help in the winemaking process and contribute to stabilizing the final product. For example, LAB exhibit peptidolytic and proteolytic activity that could break down the proteins causing wine haze, potentially reducing the need for bentonite addition. Other potential contributions include pectinolytic activity, which could aid juice clarification and the ability to break down acetaldehyde, even when bound to SO2, reducing the need for SO2 additions during winemaking. Considering all these findings, this review summarizes the novel enzymatic activities of LAB that positively or negatively affect the quality of wine. Inoculation strategies, LAB improvement strategies, their potential to be used as targeted additions, and technological advances involving their use in wine are highlighted along with suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {Motivation: The Glimmer gene-finding software has been successfully used for finding genes in bacteria, arch{\ae}a and viruses representing hundreds of species. We describe several major changes to the Glimmer system, including improved methods for identifying both coding regions and start codons. We also describe a new module of Glimmer that can distinguish host and endosymbiont DNA. This module was developed in response to the discovery that eukaryotic genome sequencing projects sometimes inadvertently capture the DNA of intracellular bacteria living in the host. Results: The new methods dramatically reduce the rate of false-positive predictions, while maintaining Glimmer's 99 sensitivity rate at detecting genes in most species, and they find substantially more correct start sites, as measured by comparisons to known and well-curated genes. We show that our interpolated Markov model (IMM) DNA discriminator correctly separated 99 of the sequences in a recent genome project that produced a mixture of sequences from the bacterium Prochloron didemni and its sea squirt host, Lissoclinum patella. {\textcopyright} 2007 Oxford University Press.},

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences.

abstract = {Urinary tract infection (UTI) is most often caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC inoculation into the female urinary tract (UT) can occur through physical activities that expose the UT to an inherently polymicrobial periurethral, vaginal, or gastrointestinal flora. We report that a common urogenital inhabitant and opportunistic pathogen, group B Streptococcus (GBS), when present at the time of UPEC exposure, undergoes rapid UPEC-dependent exclusion from the murine urinary tract, yet it influences acute UPEC-host interactions and alters host susceptibility to persistent outcomes of bladder and kidney infection. GBS presence results in increased UPEC titers in the bladder lumen during acute infection and reduced inflammatory responses of murine macrophages to live UPEC or purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phenotypes that require GBS mimicry of host sialic acid residues. Taken together, these studies suggest that despite low titers, the presence of GBS at the time of polymi-crobial UT exposure may be an overlooked risk factor for chronic pyelonephritis and recurrent UTI in susceptible groups, even if it is outcompeted and thus absent by the time of diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2012, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract = {The microorganism–microorganism or microorganism–host interactions are the key strategy to colonize and establish in a variety of different environments. These interactions involve all ecological aspects, including physiochemical changes, metabolite exchange, metabolite conversion, signaling, chemotaxis and genetic exchange resulting in genotype selection. In addition, the establishment in the environment depends on the species diversity, since high functional redundancy in the microbial community increases the competitive ability of the community, decreasing the possibility of an invader to establish in this environment. Therefore, these associations are the result of a co-evolution process that leads to the adaptation and specialization, allowing the occupation of different niches, by reducing biotic and abiotic stress or exchanging growth factors and signaling. Microbial interactions occur by the transference of molecular and genetic information, and many mechanisms can be involved in this exchange, such as secondary metabolites, siderophores, quorum sensing system, biofilm formation, and cellular transduction signaling, among others. The ultimate unit of interaction is the gene expression of each organism in response to an environmental (biotic or abiotic) stimulus, which is responsible for the production of molecules involved in these interactions. Therefore, in the present review, we focused on some molecular mechanisms involved in the microbial interaction, not only in microbial–host interaction, which has been exploited by other reviews, but also in the molecular strategy used by different microorganisms in the environment that can modulate the establishment and structuration of the microbial community.},

We investigated how fine-tuning cheese-making process parameters changed the cheese volatilome in a semi-hard cheese inoculated with Lactococcus (L.) lactis, Lactiplantibacillus (L.) plantarum, and Propionibacterium (P.) freudenreichii. A standard (Std) cheese was compared with three variants of technological itineraries: a shorter salting time (7 h vs 10 h, Salt7h), a shorter stirring time (15 min vs 30 min, Stir15min), or a higher ripening temperature (16 °C vs 13 °C, Rip16°C). Bacterial counts were similar in the four cheese types, except for a 1.4 log10 reduction of L. lactis counts in Rip16°C cheeses after 7 weeks of ripening. Compared to Std, Stir15min and Rip16°C increased propionibacterial activity, causing higher concentrations of acetic, succinic, and propanoic acids and lower levels of lactic acid. Rip16°C accelerated secondary proteolysis and volatile production. We thus demonstrated that fine-tuning process parameters could modulate the cheese volatilome by influencing specific bacterial metabolisms.},

The present study investigated whether colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings by Trichoderma atroviride affected plant growth and development. Here it is shown that T. atroviride promotes growth in Arabidopsis. Moreover, T. atroviride produced indole compounds in liquid cultures. These results suggest that indoleacetic acid-related indoles (IAA-related indoles) produced by T. atroviride may have a stimulatory effect on plant growth. In addition, whether colonization of Arabidopsis roots by T. atroviride can induce systemic protection against foliar pathogens was tested. Arabidopsis roots inoculation with T. atroviride provided systemic protection to the leaves inoculated with bacterial and fungal pathogens. To investigate the possible pathway involved in the systemic resistance induced by T. atroviride, the expression profile of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid/ethylene, oxidative burst and camalexin related genes was assessed in Arabidopsis. T. atroviride induced an overlapped expression of defence-related genes of SA and JA/ET pathways, and of the gene involved in the synthesis of the antimicrobial phytoalexin, camalexin, both locally and systemically. This is the first report where colonization of Arabidopsis roots by T. atroviride induces the expression of SA and JA/ET pathways simultaneously to confer resistance against hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic phytopathogens. The beneficial effects induced by the inoculation of Arabidopsis roots with T. atroviride and the induction of the plant defence system suggest a molecular dialogue between these organisms. {\textcopyright} 2011 KNPV.},

abstract = {A key challenge in microbiome research is to predict the functionality of microbial communities based on community membership and (meta)-genomic data. As central microbiota functions are determined by bacterial community networks, it is important to gain insight into the principles that govern bacteria-bacteria interactions. Here, we focused on the growth and metabolic interactions of the Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (OMM12) synthetic bacterial community, which is increasingly used as a model system in gut microbiome research. Using a bottom-up approach, we uncovered the directionality of strain-strain interactions in mono- and pairwise co-culture experiments as well as in community batch culture. Metabolic network reconstruction in combination with metabolomics analysis of bacterial culture supernatants provided insights into the metabolic potential and activity of the individual community members. Thereby, we could show that the OMM12 interaction network is shaped by both exploitative and interference competition in vitro in nutrient-rich culture media and demonstrate how community structure can be shifted by changing the nutritional environment. In particular, Enterococcus faecalis KB1 was identified as an important driver of community composition by affecting the abundance of several other consortium members in vitro. As a result, this study gives fundamental insight into key drivers and mechanistic basis of the OMM12 interaction network in vitro, which serves as a knowledge base for future mechanistic in vivo studies.},

abstract = {Metabolic network alignment is a system scale comparative analysis that discovers important similarities and differences across different metabolisms and organisms. Although the problem of aligning metabolic networks has been considered in the past, the computational complexity of the existing solutions has so far limited their use to moderately sized networks. In this paper, we address the problem of aligning two metabolic networks, particularly when both of them are too large to be dealt with using existing methods. We develop a generic framework that can significantly improve the scale of the networks that can be aligned in practical time. Our framework has three major phases, namely the compression phase, the alignment phase and the refinement phase. For the first phase, we develop an algorithm which transforms the given networks to a compressed domain where they are summarized using fewer nodes, termed supernodes, and interactions. In the second phase, we carry out the alignment in the compressed domain using an existing network alignment method as our base algorithm. This alignment results in supernode mappings in the compressed domain, each of which are smaller instances of network alignment problem. In the third phase, we solve each of the instances using the base alignment algorithm to refine the alignment results. We provide a user defined parameter to control the number of compression levels which generally determines the tradeoff between the quality of the alignment versus how fast the algorithm runs. Our experiments on the networks from KEGG pathway database demonstrate that the compression method we propose reduces the sizes of metabolic networks by almost half at each compression level which provides an expected speedup of more than an order of magnitude. We also observe that the alignments obtained by only one level of compression capture the original alignment results with high accuracy. Together, these suggest that our framework results in alignments that are comparable to existing algorithms and can do this with practical resource utilization for large scale networks that existing algorithms could not handle. As an example of our method's performance in practice, the alignment of organism-wide metabolic networks of human (1615 reactions) and mouse (1600 reactions) was performed under three minutes by only using a single level of compression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Ay et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Resource competition and metabolic cross-feeding are among the main drivers of microbial community assembly. Yet the degree to which these two conflicting forces are reflected in the composition of natural communities has not been systematically investigated. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic modelling to assess the potential for resource competition and metabolic cooperation in large co-occurring groups (up to 40 members) across thousands of habitats. Our analysis reveals two distinct community types, which are clustered at opposite ends of a spectrum in a trade-off between competition and cooperation. At one end are highly cooperative communities, characterized by smaller genomes and multiple auxotrophies. At the other end are highly competitive communities, which feature larger genomes and overlapping nutritional requirements, and harbour more genes related to antimicrobial activity. The latter are mainly present in soils, whereas the former are found in both free-living and host-associated habitats. Community-scale flux simulations show that, whereas competitive communities can better resist species invasion but not nutrient shift, cooperative communities are susceptible to species invasion but resilient to nutrient change. We also show, by analysing an additional data set, that colonization by probiotic species is positively associated with the presence of cooperative species in the recipient microbiome. Together, our results highlight the bifurcation between competitive and cooperative metabolism in the assembly of natural communities and its implications for community modulation.},

The mechanisms underlying long-term coexistence remain unclear as system-wide studies have been largely limited to engineered communities, ex situ adapted cultures or synthetic assemblies. Here, we show how kefir, a natural milk-fermenting community of prokaryotes (predominantly lactic and acetic acid bacteria) and yeasts (family Saccharomycetaceae), realizes stable coexistence through spatiotemporal orchestration of species and metabolite dynamics. During milk fermentation, kefir grains (a polysaccharide matrix synthesized by kefir microorganisms) grow in mass but remain unchanged in composition. In contrast, the milk is colonized in a sequential manner in which early members open the niche for the followers by making available metabolites such as amino acids and lactate. Through metabolomics, transcriptomics and large-scale mapping of inter-species interactions, we show how microorganisms poorly suited for milk survive in—and even dominate—the community, through metabolic cooperation and uneven partitioning between grain and milk. Overall, our findings reveal how inter-species interactions partitioned in space and time lead to stable coexistence. Using kefir as a natural model microbial ecosystem, the authors apply metabolomics, transcriptomics and large-scale mapping of inter-species interactions to study the drivers of stable coexistence of species in space and time.}},

abstract = {{Food fermentation has been practised since ancient times to improve sensory properties and food preservation. This review discusses the process of fermentation, which has undergone remarkable improvement over the years, from relying on natural microbes and spontaneous fermentation to back-slopping and the use of starter cultures. Modern biotechnological approaches, including genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9, have been investigated and hold promise for improving the fermentation process. The invention of next-generation sequencing techniques and the rise of meta-omics tools have advanced our knowledge on the characterisation of microbiomes involved in food fermentation and their functional roles. The contribution and potential advantages of meta-omics technologies in understanding the process of fermentation and examples of recent studies utilising multi-omics approaches for studying food-fermentation microbiomes are reviewed. Recent technological advances in studying food fermentation have provided insights into the ancient wisdom in the practice of food fermentation, such as the choice of substrates and fermentation conditions leading to desirable properties. This review aims to stimulate research on the process of fermentation and the associated microbiomes to produce fermented food efficiently and sustainably. Prospects and the usefulness of recent advances in molecular tools and integrated multi-omics approaches are highlighted.}},

To address this question, the dairy-origin lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, commonly used in cheese starter cultures, were grown in pure and four different co-cultures. We used a dynamic metabolic modelling approach based on the integration of the genome-scale metabolic networks of the involved organisms to simulate the co-cultures. The strain-specific kinetic parameters of dynamic models were estimated using the pure culture experiments and they were subsequently applied to co-culture models. Biomass, carbon source, lactic acid and most of the amino acid concentration profiles simulated by the co-culture models fit closely to the experimental results and the co-culture models explained the mechanisms behind the dynamic microbial abundance. We then applied the co-culture models to estimate further information on the co-cultures that could not be obtained by the experimental method used. This includes estimation of the profile of various metabolites in the co-culture medium such as flavour compounds produced and the individual organism level metabolic exchange flux profiles, which revealed the potential metabolic interactions between organisms in the co-cultures.}},

This vast literature has been systematically assembled into a reconstruction of the biochemical reaction networks that underlie E. coli’s functions, a process which is now being applied to an increasing number of microorganisms. Genome-scale reconstructed networks are organized and systematized knowledge bases that have multiple uses, including conversion into computational models that interpret and predict phenotypic states and the consequences of environmental and genetic perturbations. These genome-scale models (GEMs) now enable us to develop pan-genome analyses that provide mechanistic insights, detail the selection pressures on proteome allocation and address stress phenotypes. In this Review, we first discuss the overall development of GEMs and their applications. Next, we review the evolution of the most complete GEM that has been developed to date: the E. coli GEM. Finally, we explore three emerging areas in genome-scale modelling of microbial phenotypes: collections of strain-specific models, metabolic and macromolecular expression models, and simulation of stress responses. Genome-scale models (GEMs) are mathematical representations of reconstructed networks that facilitate computation and prediction of phenotypes, and are useful tools for predicting the biological capabilities of microorganisms.

Constraint-based modeling (CBM) enables both the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the reconstructed networks. The rapid advancements in these areas can benefit both the industrial production of microbial food cultures and their application in food processing. CBM provides several avenues for improving our mechanistic understanding of physiology and genotype–phenotype relationships. This is essential for the rational improvement of industrial strains, which can further be facilitated through various model-guided strain design approaches. CBM of microbial communities offers a valuable tool for the rational design of defined food cultures, where it can catalyze hypothesis generation and provide unintuitive rationales for the development of enhanced community phenotypes and, consequently, novel or improved food products. In the industrial-scale production of microorganisms for food cultures, CBM may enable a knowledge-driven bioprocess optimization by rationally identifying strategies for growth and stability improvement. Through these applications, we believe that CBM can become a powerful tool for guiding the areas of strain development, culture development and process optimization in the production of food cultures. Nevertheless, in order to make the correct choice of the modeling framework for a particular application and to interpret model predictions in a biologically meaningful manner, one should be aware of the current limitations of CBM.}},

abstract = {Information on the factors influencing citrate metabolism in lactobacilli is limited and could be useful in understanding the growth of lactobacilli in ripening cheese. Citrate was not used as an energy source by either Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 or Lact. plantarum 1919 and did not affect the growth rate when co-metabolized with glucose or galactose. In growing cells, metabolism of citrate was minimal at pH 6 but significant at pH 4.5 and was greater in cells co-metabolizing galactose than in those co- metabolizing glucose or lactose. In non-growing cells, optimum utilization of citrate also occurred at pH 4.5 and was not increased substantially by the presence of fermentable sugars. In both growing and non-growing cells, acetate and acetoin were the major products of citrate metabolism; pyruvate was also produced by non-growing cells and was transformed to acetoin once the citrate was exhausted. Citrate was metabolized more rapidly than sugar by non-growing cells; the reverse was true of growing cells. Citrate metabolism by Lact. plantarum 1919 and Lact. casei ATCC 393 increased six- and 22-fold, respectively, when the cells were pre-grown on galactose plus citrate than when pre-grown on galactose only. This was probably due to induction of citrate lyase by growth on citrate plus sugar. These results imply that lactobacilli, if present in large enough numbers, can metabolize citrate in ripening cheese in the absence of an energy source.},

abstract = {Acetolactate synthase (ALS) is a key enzyme of pyruvate metabolism and produces acetolactate which can then be converted into the flavour compound, diacetyl. The ALS from Leuconostoc lactis NCW1 displays unusual kinetic properties and is expressed at low levels. Thus, the gene encoding ALS from Leuc. lactis NCW1 was cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli to facilitate a more detailed study of its functional properties. The recombinant enzyme, purified from E. coli, was active, and its specific activity was dependent on protein concentration, a phenomenon that was also observed in crude extracts of Leuc. lactis NCW1. Circular dichroism spectra of the purified enzyme revealed a loss of secondary structure of the enzyme upon dilution. In addition, the enzyme exhibited a number of multimeric forms on non-denaturing electrophoresis. The K(m) for pyruvate and TPP decreased as the protein concentration increased. The evidence suggests that oligomerisation of enzyme subunits is enhanced at high protein concentrations and that the associated enzyme has greater specific activity than the individual monomers. The kinetic properties of this enzyme make its clone a candidate for the metabolic engineering of lactococcal strains for the increased production of diacetyl.

abstract = {Aims: The characterization of global aerobic metabolism of Lactobacillus plantarum LP652 under different aeration levels, in order to optimize acetate production kinetics and to suppress H2O2 toxicity. Methods and Results: Cultures of L. plantarum were grown on different aeration conditions. After sugar exhaustion and in the presence of oxygen, lactate was converted to acetate, H2O2 and carbon dioxide with concomitant ATP production. Physiological assays were performed at selected intervals in order to assess enzyme activity and vitality of the strain during lactic acid conversion. The maximal aerated condition led to fast lactate-to-acetate conversion kinetics between 8 and 12 h, but H 2O2 immediately accumulated, thus affecting cell metabolism. Pyruvate oxidase activity was highly enhanced by oxygen tension and was responsible for H2O2 production after 12 h of culture, whereas lactate oxidase and NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase activities were not correlated to metabolite production. Limited NADH oxidase (NOX) and NADH peroxidase (NPR) activities were probably responsible for toxic H 2O2 levels in over-aerated cultures. Conclusion: Modulating initial airflow led to the maximal specific activity of NOX and NPR observed after 24 h of culture, thus promoting H2O2 destruction and strain vitality at the end of the process. Significance and Impact of the study: Optimal aeration conditions were determined to minimize H2O2 concentration level during growth on lactate. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Dairy propionibacteria are Actinobacteria, mainly isolated from dairy environments. Propionibacterium freudenreichii has been used for a long time as a ripening culture in Swiss-type cheese manufacture, and is more and more considered for its potent probiotic effects. This review summarises the knowledge on the main P. freudenreichii pathways and the main features explaining its hardiness, and focuses on recent advances concerning its applications as a cheese ripening agent and as a probiotic for human health. Propionibacteria have a peculiar metabolism, characterised by the formation of propionic acid as main fermentation end-product. They have few nutritional requirements and are able to use a variety of carbon substrates. From the sequence of P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA1 T genome, many pathways were reconstituted, including the Wood-Werkman cycle, enzymes of the respiratory chain, synthesis pathways for all amino acids and many vitamins including vitamin B 12. P. freudenreichii displays features allowing its long-term survival. It accumulates inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) as energy reserve, carbon storage compounds (glycogen), and compatible solutes such as trehalose. In cheese, P. freudenreichii plays an essential role in the production of a variety of flavour compounds, including not only propionic acid, but also free fatty acids released via lipolysis of milk glycerides and methyl-butanoic acids resulting from amino acid degradation. P. freudenreichii can exert health-promoting activities, such as a bifidogenic effect in the human gut and promising immunomodulatory effects. Many P. freudenreichii properties involved in adaptation, cheese ripening, bio-preservation and probiotic effects are highly strain-dependent. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved is now facilitated by the availability of genome sequence and molecular tools. It will help in the selection of the most appropriate strain for each application. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study we show increased biomass formation for four species of food-grade propionic acid bacteria (Acidipropionibacterium acidipropionici, Acidipropionibacterium jensenii, Acidipropionibacterium thoenii and Propionibacterium freudenreichii) when exposed to oxygen, implicating functional respiratory systems. Using an optimal microaerobic condition, P. freudenreichii DSM 20271 consumed lactate to produce propionate and acetate initially. When lactate was depleted propionate was oxidized to acetate. We propose to name the switch from propionate production to consumption in microaerobic conditions the ‘propionate switch'. When propionate was depleted the ‘acetate switch' occurred, resulting in complete consumption of acetate. Both growth rate on lactate (0.100 versus 0.078 h−1) and biomass yield (20.5 versus 8.6 g* mol−1 lactate) increased compared to anaerobic conditions. Proteome analysis revealed that the abundance of proteins involved in the aerobic and anaerobic electron transport chains and major metabolic pathways did not significantly differ between anaerobic and microaerobic conditions. This implicates that P. freudenreichii is prepared for utilizing O2 when it comes available in anaerobic conditions. The ecological niche of propionic acid bacteria can conceivably be extended to environments with oxygen gradients from oxic to anoxic, so-called microoxic environments, as found in the rumen, gut and soils, where they can thrive by utilizing low concentrations of oxygen.},

abstract = { More than 90\% of the aspartate in a defined medium was metabolized after lactate exhaustion such that 3 mol of aspartate and 1 mol of propionate were converted to 3 mol of succinate, 3 mol of ammonia, 1 mol of acetate, and 1 mol of CO2. This pathway was also evident when propionate and aspartate were the substrates in complex medium in the absence of lactate. In complex medium with lactate present, about 70\% of the aspartate was metabolized to succinate and ammonia during lactate fermentation, and as a consequence of aspartate metabolism, more lactate was fermented to acetate and CO2 than was fermented to propionate. The conversion of aspartate to fumarate and ammonia by the enzyme aspartase and subsequent reduction of fumarate to succinate occurred in the five strains of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii studied. The ability to metabolize aspartate in the presence of lactate appeared to be related to aspartase activity. The specific activity of aspartase increased during and after lactate utilization, and the levels of this enzyme were lower in cells grown in defined medium than levels in those cells grown in complex medium. Under the conditions used, no other amino acids were readily metabolized in the presence of lactate. The possibility that aspartate metabolism by propionibacteria in Swiss cheese has an influence on CO2 production is discussed. }

abstract = {This review describes recent scientific research on the production of aroma compounds by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fermented food products. We discuss the various precursor molecules for the formation of aroma compounds in connection with the metabolic pathways involved. The roles of nonmetabolic properties such as cell lysis are also described in relation to aroma formation. Finally, we provide an overview of the literature on methods to steer and control aroma formation by LAB in mixed culture fermentations. We demonstrate that the technological progress made recently in high-throughput analysis methods has been driving the development of new approaches to understand, control, and steer aroma formation in (dairy) fermentation processes. This currently entails proposing new rules for designing stable, high-performance mixed cultures constituting a selection of strains, which in concert and on the basis of their individual predicted gene contents deliver the required functionalities.

abstract = {In vivo 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to elucidate the pathways and the regulation of pyruvate metabolism and pyruvate-lactate cometabolism noninvasively in living-cell suspensions of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp, shermanii. The most important result of this work concerns the modification of fluxes of pyruvate metabolism induced by the presence of lactate. Pyruvate was temporarily converted to lactate and alanine; the flux to acetate synthesis was maintained, but the flux to propionate synthesis was increased; and the reverse flux of the first part of the Wood-Werkman cycle, up to acetate synthesis, was decreased. Pyruvate was consumed at apparent initial rates of 148 and 90 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} g-1 (cell dry weight) when it was the sole substrate or cometabolized with lactate, respectively. Lactate was consumed at an apparent initial rate of 157 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} g-1 when it was cometabolized with pyruvate. P. shermanii used several pathways, namely, the Wood-Werkman cycle, synthesis of acetate and CO2, succinate synthesis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and alanine synthesis, to manage its pyruvate pool sharply. In both types of experiments, acetate synthesis and the Wood-Werkman cycle were the metabolic pathways used most.},

Transcription studies showed that the four tagatose 6-phosphate pathway genes are the first genes of the lactose-inducible lactose-phosphotransferase operon consisting of the lacABCDFEGX genes. Using a T7 expression system, it could be shown that the lacA, lacB, lacC, and lacD genes code for proteins with apparent molecular masses of 15, 19, 33, and 36 kDa, respectively. Cell-free extracts of induced and noninduced Escherichia coli cells expressing the lacABCD genes were used to determine the functions of the encoded proteins. Expression of both lacA and lacB was required to obtain galactose-6-phosphate isomerase activity. The lacC gene codes for tagatose-6-phosphate kinase, the deduced amino sequence of which is similar to that of E. coli Pfk-2 phosphofructokinase, and Staphylococcus aureus LacC protein. The tagatose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase is encoded by the lacD gene, and its deduced primary sequence, which is homologous to that of the S. aureus LacD protein, predicts an amino acid composition which is virtually identical to that of the previously purified L. lactis E8 tagatose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase.},

abstract = {The 3,308,274-bp sequence of the chromosome of Lactobacillus plantarum strain WCFS1, a single colony isolate of strain NCIMB8826 that was originally isolated from human saliva, has been determined, and contains 3,052 predicted protein-encoding genes. Putative biological functions could be assigned to 2,120 (70\%) of the predicted proteins. Consistent with the classification of L. plantarum as a facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium, the genome encodes all enzymes required for the glycolysis and phosphoketolase pathways, all of which appear to belong to the class of potentially highly expressed genes in this organism, as was evident from the codon-adaptation index of individual genes. Moreover, L. plantarum encodes a large pyruvate-dissipating potential, leading to various end-products of fermentation. L. plantarum is a species that is encountered in many different environmental niches, and this flexible and adaptive behavior is reflected by the relatively large number of regulatory and transport functions, including 25 complete PTS sugar transport systems. Moreover, the chromosome encodes >200 extracellular proteins, many of which are predicted to be bound to the cell envelope. A large proportion of the genes encoding sugar transport and utilization, as well as genes encoding extracellular functions, appear to be clustered in a 600-kb region near the origin of replication. Many of these genes display deviation of nucleotide composition, consistent with a foreign origin. These findings suggest that these genes, which provide an important part of the interaction of L. plantarum with its environment, form a lifestyle adaptation region in the chromosome.},

@article{Loux2015,
abstract = {Background: Propionibacterium freudenreichii (PF) is an actinobacterium used in cheese technology and for its probiotic properties. PF is also extremely adaptable to several ecological niches and can grow on a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. The aim of this work was to discover the genetic basis for strain-dependent traits related to its ability to use specific carbon sources. High-throughput sequencing technologies were ideal for this purpose as they have the potential to decipher genomic diversity at a moderate cost. Results: 21 strains of PF were sequenced and the genomes were assembled de novo. Scaffolds were ordered by comparison with the complete reference genome CIRM-BIA1, obtained previously using traditional Sanger sequencing. Automatic functional annotation and manual curation were performed. Each gene was attributed to either the core genome or an accessory genome. The ability of the 21 strains to degrade 50 different sugars was evaluated. Thirty-three sugars were degraded by none of the sequenced strains whereas eight sugars were degraded by all of them. The corresponding genes were present in the core genome. Lactose, melibiose and xylitol were only used by some strains. In this case, the presence/absence of genes responsible for carbon uptake and degradation correlated well with the phenotypes, with the exception of xylitol. Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of these genes was in line the metabolic pathways described previously in other species. We also considered the genetic origin (transduction, rearrangement) of the corresponding genomic islands. Ribose and gluconate were degraded to a greater or lesser extent (quantitative phenotype) by some strains. For these sugars, the phenotypes could not be explained by the presence/absence of a gene but correlated with the premature appearance of a stop codon interrupting protein synthesis and preventing the catabolism of corresponding carbon sources. Conclusion: These results illustrate (i) the power of correlation studies to discover the genetic basis of binary strain-dependent traits, and (ii) the plasticity of PF chromosomes, probably resulting from horizontal transfers, duplications, transpositions and an accumulation of mutations. Knowledge of the genetic basis of nitrogen and sugar degradation opens up new strategies for the screening of PF strain collections to enable optimum cheese starter, probiotic and white biotechnology applications.},

abstract = {Propionibacterium is an anaerobic bacterium with a history of use in the production of Swiss cheese and, more recently, several industrial bioproducts. While the use of this strain for the production of organic acids and secondary metabolites has gained growing interest, the industrial application of the strain requires further improvement in the yield and productivity of the target products. Systems modeling and analysis of metabolic networks are widely leveraged to gain holistic insights into the metabolic features of biotechnologically important strains and to devise metabolic engineering and culture optimization strategies for economically viable bioprocess development. In the present study, a high-quality genome-scale metabolic model of P. freudenreichii ssp. freudenreichii strain DSM 20271 was developed based on the strain's genome annotation and biochemical and physiological data. The model covers the functions of 23\% of the strain's ORFs and accounts for 711 metabolic reactions and 647 unique metabolites. Literature-based reconstruction of the central metabolism and rigorous renement of annotation data for establishing gene-protein-reaction associations renders the model a curated omic-scale knowledge base of the organism. Validation of the model against experimental data indicates that the reconstruction can capture the key structural and functional features of P. freudenreichii metabolism, including the growth rate, the pattern of ux distribution, the strain's aerotolerance behavior, and the change in the mode of metabolic activity during the transition from an anaerobic to an aerobic growth regime. The model also includes an accurately curated pathway of cobalamin biosynthesis, which was used to examine the capacity of the strain to produce vitamin B12 precursors. Constraint-based reconstruction and analysis of the P. freudenreichii metabolic network also provided novel insights into the complexity and robustness of P. freudenreichii energy metabolism. The developed reconstruction, hence, may be used as a platform for the development of P. freudenreichii-based microbial cell factories and bioprocesses.},

Typically, FBA is used to study the metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system. However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have extended FBA to account for dynamics and present two different formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic FBA was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental data. The dynamic FBA formalism was also used to study the sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were also identified. Therefore, dynamic FBA provides a framework for analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of metabolic networks.}},

This species exhibits slow growth, low nutritional requirements, and hardiness in many habitats. It belongs to the taxonomic group of dairy propionibacteria, in contrast to the cutaneous species P. acnes. The genome of the type strain, P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii CIRM-BIA1 (CIP 103027T), was sequenced with an 11-fold coverage. The circular chromosome of 2.7 Mb of the CIRM-BIA1 strain has a GC-content of 67\% and contains 22 different insertion sequences (3.5\% of the genome in base pairs). Using a proteomic approach, 490 of the 2439 predicted proteins were confirmed. The annotation revealed the genetic basis for the hardiness of P. freudenreichii, as the bacterium possesses a complete enzymatic arsenal for de novo biosynthesis of aminoacids and vitamins (except panthotenate and biotin) as well as sequences involved in metabolism of various carbon sources, immunity against phages, duplicated chaperone genes and, interestingly, genes involved in the management of polyphosphate, glycogen and trehalose storage. The complete biosynthesis pathway for a bifidogenic compound is described, as well as a high number of surface proteins involved in interactions with the host and present in other probiotic bacteria. By comparative genomics, no pathogenicity factors found in P. acnes or in other pathogenic microbial species were identified in P. freudenreichii, which is consistent with the Generally Recognized As Safe and Qualified Presumption of Safety status of P. freudenreichii. Various pathways for formation of cheese flavor compounds were identified: the Wood-Werkman cycle for propionic acid formation, amino acid degradation pathways resulting in the formation of volatile branched chain fatty acids, and esterases involved in the formation of free fatty acids and esters. With the exception of its ability to degrade lactose, P. freudenreichii seems poorly adapted to dairy niches. This genome annotation opens up new prospects for the understanding of the P. freudenreichii probiotic activity.}},

While Illumina data is appropriate for many analyses, its short read length limits its ability to resolve genomic structure. This has major implications for tracking the spread of mobile genetic elements, including those which carry antimicrobial resistance determinants. Fully resolving a bacterial genome requires long-read sequencing such as those generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Here we describe our use of the ONT MinION to sequence 12 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae on a single flow cell. We assembled each genome using a combination of ONT reads and previously available Illumina reads, and little to no manual intervention was needed to achieve fully resolved assemblies using the Unicycler hybrid assembler. Assembling only ONT reads with Canu was less effective, resulting in fewer resolved genomes and higher error rates even following error correction with Nanopolish. We demonstrate that multiplexed ONT sequencing is a valuable tool for high-throughput bacterial genome finishing. Specifically, we advocate the use of Illumina sequencing as a first analysis step, followed by ONT reads as needed to resolve genomic structure.},

Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies DNA sequencing platforms generate long reads that can produce complete genome assemblies, but the sequencing is more expensive and error-prone. There is significant interest in combining data from these complementary sequencing technologies to generate more accurate “hybrid” assemblies. However, few tools exist that truly leverage the benefits of both types of data, namely the accuracy of short reads and the structural resolving power of long reads. Here we present Unicycler, a new tool for assembling bacterial genomes from a combination of short and long reads, which produces assemblies that are accurate, complete and cost-effective. Unicycler builds an initial assembly graph from short reads using the de novo assembler SPAdes and then simplifies the graph using information from short and long reads. Unicycler uses a novel semi-global aligner to align long reads to the assembly graph. Tests on both synthetic and real reads show Unicycler can assemble larger contigs with fewer misassemblies than other hybrid assemblers, even when long-read depth and accuracy are low.

abstract = {Escher is a web application for visualizing data on biological pathways. Three key features make Escher a uniquely effective tool for pathway visualization. First, users can rapidly design new pathway maps. Escher provides pathway suggestions based on user data and genome-scale models, so users can draw pathways in a semi-automated way. Second, users can visualize data related to genes or proteins on the associated reactions and pathways, using rules that define which enzymes catalyze each reaction. Thus, users can identify trends in common genomic data types (e.g. RNA-Seq, proteomics, ChIP)—in conjunction with metabolite- and reaction-oriented data types (e.g. metabolomics, fluxomics). Third, Escher harnesses the strengths of web technologies (SVG, D3, developer tools) so that visualizations can be rapidly adapted, extended, shared, and embedded. This paper provides examples of each of these features and explains how the development approach used for Escher can be used to guide the development of future visualization tools.},

The grapevine microbiome has been extensively described over the last decade, primarily using metabarcoding approaches. Unfortunately, metabarcoding data alone provide little information on microbial functions and outcomes of plant-microbe interactions. Here we review knowledge about the microorganisms that have a demonstrated influence, positive or negative, on the performance of the grapevine holobiont. Our review encompasses bacteria, filamentous fungi, yeasts, oomycetes and viruses. It covers aboveground and belowground microorganisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi. We focus on taxa and functions that protect the plant against pathogens and pests, promote growth, increase tolerance to abiotic stresses and highlight those involved in disease and decline. As the outcomes of plant-microbe interactions are labile, we examine the dynamics and functions of grapevine-microbiome interactions over both the plant lifetime and the plant evolutionary history, beginning with plant domestication. Based on the knowledge and gaps we identify, we suggest field sampling designs, culture-based experiments, molecular tools and theoretical analysis methods, including shotgun metagenomics and network models, that could be used in future research to uncover and leverage the full functional potential of the grapevine microbiome.}},

@article{Rousk2016,
	abstract = {Abstract Half the global soil carbon (C) is held in high-latitude systems. Climate change will expose these to warming and a shift towards plant communities with more labile C input. Labile C can also increase the rate of loss of native soil organic matter (SOM); a phenomenon termed `priming'. We investigated how warming (+1.1 $\,^{\circ}$C over ambient using open top chambers) and litter addition (90 g m−2 yr−1) treatments in the subarctic influenced the susceptibility of SOM mineralization to priming, and its microbial underpinnings. Labile C appeared to inhibit the mineralization of C from SOM by up to 60\% within hours. In contrast, the mineralization of N from SOM was stimulated by up to 300\%. These responses occurred rapidly and were unrelated to microbial successional dynamics, suggesting catabolic responses. Considered separately, the labile C inhibited C mineralization is compatible with previously reported findings termed `preferential substrate utilization' or `negative apparent priming', while the stimulated N mineralization responses echo recent reports of `real priming' of SOM mineralization. However, C and N mineralization responses derived from the same SOM source must be interpreted together: This suggested that the microbial SOM-use decreased in magnitude and shifted to components richer in N. This finding highlights that only considering SOM in terms of C may be simplistic, and will not capture all changes in SOM decomposition. The selective mining for N increased in climate change treatments with higher fungal dominance. In conclusion, labile C appeared to trigger catabolic responses of the resident microbial community that shifted the SOM mining to N-rich components; an effect that increased with higher fungal dominance. Extrapolating from these findings, the predicted shrub expansion in the subarctic could result in an altered microbial use of SOM, selectively mining it for N-rich components, and leading to a reduced total SOM-use.},

@article{Fazzino2020,
abstract = {Bacteriophage shape the composition and function of microbial communities. Yet it remains difficult to predict the effect of phage on microbial interactions. Specifically, little is known about how phage influence mutualisms in networks of cross-feeding bacteria. We mathematically modeled the impacts of phage in a synthetic microbial community in which Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica exchange essential metabolites. In this model, independent phage attack of either species was sufficient to temporarily inhibit both members of the mutualism; however, the evolution of phage resistance facilitated yields similar to those observed in the absence of phage. In laboratory experiments, attack of S. enterica with P22vir phage followed these modeling expectations of delayed community growth with little change in the final yield of bacteria. In contrast, when E. coli was attacked with T7 phage, S. enterica, the nonhost species, reached higher yields compared with no-phage controls. T7 infection increased nonhost yield by releasing consumable cell debris, and by driving evolution of partially resistant E. coli that secreted more carbon. Our results demonstrate that phage can have extensive indirect effects in microbial communities, that the nature of these indirect effects depends on metabolic and evolutionary mechanisms, and that knowing the degree of evolved resistance leads to qualitatively different predictions of bacterial community dynamics in response to phage attack.},

abstract = {{Metabolic exchange mediates interactions among microbes, helping explain diversity in microbial communities. As these interactions often involve a fitness cost, it is unclear how stable cooperation can emerge. Here we use genome-scale metabolic models to investigate whether the release of “costless” metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producer), can be a prominent driver of intermicrobial interactions. By performing over 2 million pairwise growth simulations of 24 species in a combinatorial assortment of environments, we identify a large space of metabolites that can be secreted without cost, thus generating ample cross-feeding opportunities. In addition to providing an atlas of putative interactions, we show that anoxic conditions can promote mutualisms by providing more opportunities for exchange of costless metabolites, resulting in an overrepresentation of stable ecological network motifs. These results may help identify interaction patterns in natural communities and inform the design of synthetic microbial consortia. In considering cross-feeding among microbes within communities, it is typically assumed that metabolic secretions are costly to produce. However, Pacheco et al. use metabolic models to show that ‘costless’ secretions could be common in some environments and important for structuring interactions among microbes.}},

We use the CGR genomes to annotate functions of 338 bacterial species, showing the utility of this resource for functional studies.

We found an extensive taxonomic overlap between the leaf and root microbiota. Genome drafts of 400 isolates revealed a large overlap of genome-encoded functional capabilities between leaf- and root-derived bacteria with few significant differences at the level of individual functional categories. Using defined bacterial communities and a gnotobiotic Arabidopsis plant system we show that the isolates form assemblies resembling natural microbiota on their cognate host organs, but are also capable of ectopic leaf or root colonization. While this raises the possibility of reciprocal relocation between root and leaf microbiota members, genome information and recolonization experiments also provide evidence for microbiota specialization to their respective niche.},

Transitioning from single-taxon genome-scale metabolic models to multitaxon models implies a growth cone without a well-specified growth rate solution for individual taxa.

We used this method to compile an atlas of predicted biosynthetic capabilities for 97 metabolites across 456 human oral microbes. This atlas captures taxonomically-related trends in biomass composition, and makes it possible to estimate inter-microbial metabolic distances that correlate with microbial co-occurrences. We also found a distinct cluster of fastidious/uncultivated taxa, including several Saccharibacteria (TM7) species, characterized by their abundant metabolic deficiencies.

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact:  mrobinson@wehi.edu.au}",

abstract = {WHO Drinking Water Quality Series **Increasingly, microbial issues are commanding the attention of water treatment operators, regulators, and the media. There are many treatment options to eliminate pathogenic microbes from drinking-water. Finding the right solution for a particular supply requires sifting through a range of sometimes competing processes. **Processes for removal of microbes from water include pretreatment, coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation, and filtration. Pretreatment processes include application of roughing filters, microstrainers, off-stream storage, or bank infiltration, each with a particular function and water quality benefit. Filtration can be accomplished using granular media filters, slow sand, precoat filters, membranes, or other filters. Oxidants may be added to water for a variety of purposes, including control of taste and odor compounds, removal of iron and manganese, Zebra Mussel control, and particle removal, among others. **For control of microbes within the distribution system, disinfectants must interact with bacteria growing in pipeline biofilms. Models for removal of particles and microbes by granular media filtration, and equations for predicting microbial inactivation by disinfectants, can aid in the understanding and prediction of the effectiveness of treatment processes for microbial pathogens. **Water Treatment and Pathogen Control is intended to provide a critical analysis of the literature on removal and inactivation of pathogenic microbes in water to aid the water quality specialist and design engineer in making important decisions regarding microbial water quality.},

Gut bacteria play an important role in human health, such as supplying essential nutrients, synthesizing vitamin K, aiding in the digestion of cellulose, and promoting angiogenesis and enteric nerve function. However, they can also be potentially harmful due to the change of their composition when the gut ecosystem undergoes abnormal changes in the light of the use of antibiotics, illness, stress, aging, bad dietary habits, and lifestyle. Dysbiosis of the gut bacteria communities can cause many chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, cancer, and autism.

abstract = {While much is known about the direct effect that temperature can have on aquatic communities, less is known about its indirect effect via the temperature dependence of viscosity and temperature-dependent trophic interactions. We manipulated the temperature (5-20 °C) and the viscosity (equivalent to 5-20 °C) of water in laboratory-based bacteria-protist communities. Communities contained food chains with one, two or three trophic levels. Responses measured were population dynamics (consumer carrying capacity and growth rate, average species population density, and the coefficient of variation of population density through time) and ecosystem function (decomposition). Temperature, viscosity and food chain length produced significant responses in population dynamics. Temperature-dependent viscosity had a significant effect on the carrying capacity and growth rates of consumers, as well as the average density of the top predator. Overall, indirect effects of temperature via changes in viscosity were subtle in comparison to the indirect effect of temperature via trophic interactions. Our results highlight the importance of direct and indirect effects of temperature, mediated through trophic interactions and physical changes in the environment, both for population dynamics and ecosystem processes. Future mechanistic modelling of effects of environmental change on species will benefit from distinguishing the different mechanisms of the overall effect of temperature. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

In farming systems, microbes play a pivotal role as the main dynamic forces. The health of the planet relies on the development of efficient and sustainable agricultural systems. Soil is the base of many of the biological processes, viz., biological nitrogen fixation, residue decomposition, mineralization/immobilization turnover, nutrient cycling, and denitrification, which are regulated by the microbes. In today's scenario, wherein the addition of chemicals is done to an extreme level, the soil has lost rich flora of beneficial microbes. It is high time to reintroduce environmentally friendly microflora into the field, so as to accomplish the goal of sustainable agriculture.

The ultraoligotrophic ecosystem of the Antarctic Dry Valleys, a simple yet highly heterogeneous ecosystem, is a natural laboratory well-suited for resolving the abiotic and biotic controls of community structure. We undertook a multidisciplinary investigation to capture ecologically relevant biotic and abiotic attributes of more than 500 sites in the Dry Valleys, encompassing observed landscape heterogeneities across more than 200 km2. Using richness of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa as a proxy for functional complexity, we linked measured variables in a parsimonious yet comprehensive structural equation model that explained significant variations in biological complexity and identified landscape-scale and fine-scale abiotic factors as the primary drivers of diversity. However, the inclusion of linkages among functional groups was essential for constructing the best-fitting model. Our findings support the notion that biotic interactions make crucial contributions even in an extremely simple ecosystem.},

Here we describe the development of a quantitative screening procedure for monitoring bacterial genetic interactions based on conjugation of Escherichia coli deletion or hypomorphic strains to create double mutants on a genome-wide scale. The patterns of synthetic sickness and synthetic lethality (aggravating genetic interactions) we observed for certain double mutant combinations provided information about functional relationships and redundancy between pathways and enabled us to group bacterial gene products into functional modules.},

We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

We present a unifying, systematic approach based on PETRI nets for storing, displaying, comparing, searching and simulating such nets from a number of different sources. Results: Information from each data source is extracted and compiled into a PETRI net. Such PETRI nets then allow to investigate the (differential) content in metabolic databases, to map and integrate genomic information and functional annotations, to compare sequence and metabolic databases with respect to their functional annotations, and to define, generate and search paths and pathways in nets. We present an algorithm to systematically generate all pathways satisfying additional constraints in such PETRI nets. Finally, based on the set of valid pathways, so-called differential metabolic displays (DMDs) are introduced to exhibit specific differences between biological systems, i.e. different developmental states, disease states, or different organisms, on the level of paths and pathways. DMDs will be useful for target finding and function prediction, especially in the context of the interpretation of expression data.

The GIMME algorithm uses quantitative gene expression data and one or more presupposed metabolic objectives to produce the context-specific reconstruction that is most consistent with the available data. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a quantitative inconsistency score indicating how consistent a set of gene expression data is with a particular metabolic objective. We show that this algorithm produces results consistent with biological experiments and intuition for adaptive evolution of bacteria, rational design of metabolic engineering strains, and human skeletal muscle cells. This work represents progress towards producing constraint-based models of metabolism that are specific to the conditions where the expression profiling data is available. {\textcopyright} 2008 Becker, Palsson.},

abstract = {Development of high throughput analytical methods has given physicians the potential access to extensive and patient-specific data sets, such as gene sequences, gene expression profiles or metabolite footprints. This opens for a new approach in health care, which is both personalized and based on system-level analysis. Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a mechanistic description of the relationships between different genes, which is valuable for the analysis and interpretation of large experimental data-sets. Here we describe the generation of genome-scale active metabolic networks for 69 different cell types and 16 cancer types using the INIT (Integrative Network Inference for Tissues) algorithm. The INIT algorithm uses cell type specific information about protein abundances contained in the Human Proteome Atlas as the main source of evidence. The generated models constitute the first step towards establishing a Human Metabolic Atlas, which will be a comprehensive description (accessible online) of the metabolism of different human cell types, and will allow for tissue-level and organism-level simulations in order to achieve a better understanding of complex diseases. A comparative analysis between the active metabolic networks of cancer types and healthy cell types allowed for identification of cancer-specific metabolic features that constitute generic potential drug targets for cancer treatment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Agren et al.},

@article{Jenior2020,
abstract = {The metabolic responses of bacteria to dynamic extracellular conditions drives not only the behavior of single species, but also entire communities of microbes. Over the last decade, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have assisted in our appreciation of important metabolic determinants of bacterial physiology. These network models have been a powerful force in understanding the metabolic capacity that species may utilize in order to succeed in an environment. Increasingly, an understanding of context-specific metabolism is critical for elucidating metabolic drivers of larger phenotypes and disease. However, previous approaches to use network models in concert with omics data to better characterize experimental systems have met challenges due to assumptions necessary by the various integration platforms or due to large input data requirements. With these challenges in mind, we developed RIPTiDe (Reaction Inclusion by Parsimony and Transcript Distribution) which uses both transcriptomic abundances and parsimony of overall flux to identify the most cost-effective usage of metabolism that also best reflects the cell's investments into transcription. Additionally, in biological samples where it is difficult to quantify specific growth conditions, it becomes critical to develop methods that require lower amounts of user intervention in order to generate accurate metabolic predictions. Utilizing a metabolic network reconstruction for the model organism Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (iJO1366), we found that RIPTiDe correctly identifies context-specific metabolic pathway activity without supervision or knowledge of specific media conditions. We also assessed the application of RIPTiDe to in vivo metatranscriptomic data where E. coli was present at high abundances, and found that our approach also effectively predicts metabolic behaviors of host-associated bacteria. In the setting of human health, understanding metabolic changes within bacteria in environments where growth substrate availability is difficult to quantify can have large downstream impacts on our ability to elucidate molecular drivers of disease-associated dysbiosis across the microbiota. Our results indicate that RIPTiDe may have potential to provide understanding of context-specific metabolism of bacteria within complex communities.},

Depending on variety, microflora and ripening conditions, lactate may be metabolized by a number of pathways to various compounds which contribute to cheese flavour or off-flavours. Citrate metabolism by citrate-positive lactococci or Leuconostoc spp. is important in certain varieties (e.g., Dutch cheeses). Lipolysis results directly in the formation of flavour compounds by liberating free fatty acids (FFA). FFA may also be metabolized to alkan-2-ones and fatty acid lactones. Proteolysis of the caseins to a range of small-and intermediate-sized peptides and free amino acids (FAA) probably only contributes to the background flavour of most cheese varieties, but FAA are important precursors for a range of poorly-understood catabolic reactions which produce volatile compounds essential for flavour.},

Existing methods are able to reverse-engineer Boolean regulations for transcriptional and signaling networks, but they fail to infer regulations that control metabolic networks. RESULTS: We present a novel approach to infer Boolean rules for metabolic regulation from time-series data and a PKN. Our method is based on a combination of answer set programming and linear programming. By solving both combinatorial and linear arithmetic constraints, we generate candidate Boolean regulations that can reproduce the given data when coupled to the metabolic network. We evaluate our approach on a core regulated metabolic network and show how the quality of the predictions depends on the available kinetic, fluxomics or transcriptomics time-series data.

@article{Pettersen2023,
abstract = {The metabolism of all living organisms is dependent on temperature, and therefore, having a good method to predict temperature effects at a system level is of importance. A recently developed Bayesian computational framework for enzyme and temperature constrained genome-scale models (etcGEM) predicts the temperature dependence of an organism's metabolic network from thermodynamic properties of the metabolic enzymes, markedly expanding the scope and applicability of constraint-based metabolic modelling. Here, we show that the Bayesian calculation method for inferring parameters for an etcGEM is unstable and unable to estimate the posterior distribution. The Bayesian calculation method assumes that the posterior distribution is unimodal, and thus fails due to the multimodality of the problem. To remedy this problem, we developed an evolutionary algorithm which is able to obtain a diversity of solutions in this multimodal parameter space. We quantified the phenotypic consequences on six metabolic network signature reactions of the different parameter solutions resulting from use of the evolutionary algorithm. While two of these reactions showed little phenotypic variation between the solutions, the remainder displayed huge variation in flux-carrying capacity. This result indicates that the model is under-determined given current experimental data and that more data is required to narrow down the model predictions. Finally, we made improvements to the software to reduce the running time of the parameter set evaluations by a factor of 8.5, allowing for obtaining results faster and with less computational resources.

A metabolic network showing the potential role of strains was reconstructed by in silico study of the six genomes and classification of dioxygenase enzymes using RHObase and AromaDeg databases. Network analysis suggested that AM and Bk were responsible for PHN initial attack, while Inq, B, T and Bc-h would degrade PHN metabolites. The predicted roles were further confirmed by physiological, RT-qPCR and metaproteomic assays. SC-1 with AM as the sole PHN degrader was the most efficient.

First, we predicted and experimentally confirmed the species ratio to which a two-species mutualistic consortium converges and the equilibrium composition of a newly engineered three-member community. We next identified a specific spatial arrangement of colonies, which gives rise to what we term the "eclipse dilemma": does a competitor placed between a colony and its cross-feeding partner benefit or hurt growth of the original colony?

In topological analyses on metabolic networks, various centrality metrics have been mostly applied to metabolite-centric graphs. However, centrality metrics including those not depending on high connections are largely unexplored for directed reaction-centric graphs. Results: We applied directed versions of centrality metrics to directed reaction-centric graphs of microbial metabolic networks. To investigate the local role of a node, we developed a novel metric, cascade number, considering how many nodes are closed off from information flow when a particular node is removed. High modularity and scale-freeness were found in the directed reaction-centric graphs and betweenness centrality tended to belong to densely connected modules. Cascade number and bridging centrality identified cascade subnetworks controlling local information flow and irreplaceable bridging nodes between functional modules, respectively. Reactions highly ranked with bridging centrality and cascade number tended to be essential, compared to reactions that other central metrics detected. Conclusions: We demonstrate that cascade number and bridging centrality are useful to identify key reactions controlling local information flow in directed reaction-centric graphs of microbial metabolic networks. Knowledge about the local flow connectivity and connections between local modules will contribute to understand how metabolic pathways are assembled.},

In this paper we measure the relation between network modularity and several aspects of robustness directly in a model system of metabolism. Methodology/Principal Findings: By using a model for generating chemical reaction systems where one can tune the network modularity, we find that robustness increases with modularity for changes in the concentrations of metabolites, whereas it decreases with changes in the expression of enzymes. The same modularity scaling is true for the speed of relaxation after the perturbations. Conclusions/Significance: Modularity is not a general principle for making metabolism either more or less robust; this question needs to be addressed specifically for different types of perturbations of the system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Petter Holme.},

Novel ways of decomposing the network into modules and motifs that could be considered as the building blocks of a network are being suggested. In this work, we introduce a new definition of motif in the context of metabolic networks. Unlike in previous works on (other) biochemical networks, this definition is not based only on topological features. We propose instead to use an alternative definition based on the functional nature of the components that form the motif, which we call a reaction motif. After introducing a formal framework motivated by biological considerations, we present complexity results on the problem of searching for all occurrences of a reaction motif in a network and introduce an algorithm that is fast in practice in most situations. We then show an initial application to the study of pathway evolution.

abstract = {The solution of the shortest path problem in biochemical systems constitutes an important step for studies of their evolution. In this paper, a linear programming (LP) algorithm for calculating minimal pathway distances in metabolic networks is studied. Minimal pathway distances are identified as the smallest number of metabolic steps separating two enzymes in metabolic pathways. The algorithm deals effectively with circularity and reaction directionality. The applicability of the algorithm is illustrated by calculating the minimal pathway distances for Escherichia coli small molecule metabolism enzymes, and then considering their correlations with genome distance (distance separating two genes on a chromosome) and enzyme function (as characterised by enzyme commission number). The results illustrate the effectiveness of the LP model. In addition, the data confirm that propinquity of genes on the genome implies similarity in function (as determined by co-involvement in the same region of the metabolic network), but suggest that no correlation exists between pathway distance and enzyme function. These findings offer insight into the probable mechanism of pathway evolution. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Author Summary In the era of fast and massive genome sequencing, one challenge is to transform sequence information into biological knowledge. Reconstructing metabolic networks that include all biochemical reactions of a cell is a way to infer reactions from genomic data. Unfortunately, those data are usually incomplete, poorly annotated, and missing reactions create gaps in the metabolic networks. Here we introduce Meneco, a tool dedicated to the parsimonious gap-filling of metabolic networks. Unlike other tools, Meneco allows using sparse data (missing stoichiometries) and draft metabolic networks to suggest reactions to fill gaps in the networks. Subsequently, we apply it to two biological case studies and show that the flexibility of Meneco enables it to be adapted to a variety of research questions and types of available data. We show that Meneco performs better than reference tools with respect to large-scale heterogeneous reference database and with respect to the recovery of important reactions in highly degraded networks. Specifically, it allowed the analysis of two interacting metabolic networks and the reconstruction of the first metabolic network of Euglena mutabilis.},

	abstract = {A network of reactions is a commonly used paradigm for representing knowledge about a biological process. How does one understand such generic networks and answer queries using them? In this paper, we present a novel approach based on translation of generic reaction networks to Boolean weighted MaxSAT. The Boolean weighted MaxSAT instance is generated by encoding the equilibrium configurations of a reaction network by weighted boolean clauses. The important feature of this translation is that it uses reactions, rather than the species, as the boolean variables. Existing weighted MaxSAT solvers are used to solve the generated instances and find equilibrium configurations. This method of analyzing reaction networks is generic, flexible and scales to large models of reaction networks. We present a few case studies to validate our claims.},

abstract="Metabolic network reconstruction is of great biological relevance because it offers a way to investigate the metabolic behavior of organisms. However, reconstruction remains a difficult task at both the biological and computational level. Building on previous work establishing an ASP-based approach to this problem, we present a report from the field resulting in the discovery of new biological knowledge. In fact, for the first time ever, we automatically reconstructed a metabolic network for a macroalgae. We accomplished this by taking advantage of ASP's combined optimization and enumeration capacities. Both computational tasks build on an improved ASP problem representation, incorporating the concept of reversible reactions. Interestingly, optimization greatly benefits from the usage of unsatisfiable cores available in the ASP solver unclasp. Applied to Ectocarpus siliculosus, only the combination of unclasp and clasp allowed us to obtain a metabolic network able to produce all recoverable metabolites among the experimentally measured ones. Moreover, 70{\%} of the identified reactions are supported by an homologous enzyme in Ectocarpus siliculosus, confirming the quality of the reconstructed network from a biological viewpoint.",

abstract = {Understanding microbial ecosystems means unlocking the path toward a deeper knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of life. Engineered microbial communities are also extremely relevant to tackling some of today's grand societal challenges. Advanced meta-omics experimental techniques provide crucial insights into microbial communities, but have been so far mostly used for descriptive, exploratory approaches to answer the initial ‘who is there?' question. An ecosystem is a complex network of dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among organisms as well as between organisms and the environment. Mathematical models with their abstraction capability are essential to capture the underlying phenomena and connect the different scales at which these systems act. Differential equation models and constraint-based stoichiometric models are deterministic approaches that can successfully provide a macroscopic description of the outcome from microscopic behaviors. In this mini-review, we present classical and recent applications of these modeling methods and illustrate the potential of their integration. Indeed, approaches that can capture multiple scales are needed in order to understand emergent patterns in ecosystems and their dynamics regulated by different spatio-temporal phenomena. We finally discuss promising examples of methods proposing the integration of differential equations with constraint-based stoichiometric models and argue that more work is needed in this direction.},

The grapevine microbiome has been extensively described over the last decade, primarily using metabarcoding approaches. Unfortunately, metabarcoding data alone provide little information on microbial functions and outcomes of plant-microbe interactions. Here we review knowledge about the microorganisms that have a demonstrated influence, positive or negative, on the performance of the grapevine holobiont. Our review encompasses bacteria, filamentous fungi, yeasts, oomycetes and viruses. It covers aboveground and belowground microorganisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi. We focus on taxa and functions that protect the plant against pathogens and pests, promote growth, increase tolerance to abiotic stresses and highlight those involved in disease and decline. As the outcomes of plant-microbe interactions are labile, we examine the dynamics and functions of grapevine-microbiome interactions over both the plant lifetime and the plant evolutionary history, beginning with plant domestication. Based on the knowledge and gaps we identify, we suggest field sampling designs, culture-based experiments, molecular tools and theoretical analysis methods, including shotgun metagenomics and network models, that could be used in future research to uncover and leverage the full functional potential of the grapevine microbiome.}

abstract = {Human intestinal microbiota is important to host health and is associated with various diseases. It is a challenge to identify the functions and metabolic activity of microorganisms at the single-cell level in gut microbial community. In this study, we applied Raman microspectroscopy and deuterium isotope probing (Raman–DIP) to quantitatively measure the metabolic activities of intestinal bacteria from two individuals and analysed lipids and phenylalanine metabolic pathways of functional microorganisms in situ. After anaerobically incubating the human faeces with heavy water (D2O), D2O with specific substrates (glucose, tyrosine, tryptophan and oleic acid) and deuterated glucose, the C–D band in single-cell Raman spectra appeared in some bacteria in faeces, due to the Raman shift from the C–H band. Such Raman shift was used to indicate the general metabolic activity and the activities in response to the specific substrates. In the two individuals' intestinal microbiota, the structures of the microbial communities were different and the general metabolic activities were 76 ± 1.0% and 30 ± 2.0%. We found that glucose, but not tyrosine, tryptophan and oleic acid, significantly stimulated metabolic activity of the intestinal bacteria. We also demonstrated that the bacteria within microbiota preferably used glucose to synthesize fatty acids in faeces environment, whilst they used glucose to synthesize phenylalanine in laboratory growth environment (e.g. LB medium). Our work provides a useful approach for investigating the metabolic activity in situ and revealing different pathways of human intestinal microbiota at the single-cell level.},
